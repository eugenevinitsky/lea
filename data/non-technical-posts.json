Photo: Mother Jones I received a notice in my newsfeed this morning that included links to videos of ICE agents arresting, and in several cases, viciously beating American citizens. These videos are hard to watch. Here is something else that's hard to do: putting a name on what's happening in this country right now with ICE arrests and demonstrations against them. It's tempting to say that the Trump administration, in the name of enforcing immigration laws, is waging a war on citizens. But it's not all citizens of America. It's only those in blue states like Minnesota and Oregon and Illinois and California. Trump is the first person in the 250-year history of this country who doesn't believe he was elected to be president of all the people. He says, and he acts, as if he is the president of those who voted for him. Everyone else, such as the people of Minneapolis, Minnesota, are enemies. They may as well be living in Iran or Venezuela, or be riding in open boats with multiple outboard motors racing through the Caribbean Sea. It's open season on everyone who didn't vote for Donald Trump, especially those who are showing up on the street to protest ICE efforts to arrest and deport undocumented immigrants. A great protest is taking place right now, but it's not like any protest we have seen before, such as those at the time of the killing of George Floyd or the mass protests against the Vietnam war. The protests are taking place one by one, against ICE agents, as they move in groups around cities in roundups of immigrants. American citizens are showing up, as they did the other day in Minneapolis, to protest the tactics of ICE. There is good reason for this, because what ICE is doing is clearly and inarguably unconstitutional. Vice President Vance said at least twice over the last few days that ICE agents will be \"going door to door\" in their roundup of undocumented immigrants. The Fourth Amendment states that, without exception, \"The right of the people to be secure i",

This week, our president announced that he would like the nation's defense budget, which already stands at $1 trillion, to be increased by $500 billion, or $600 billion. It's hard to know which is the real number, because he changes the amounts whenever a new whim is making its way through his excellently-focused mind. I refer to Donald Trump' mind as excellently-focused, because he emphasizes it all the time. He has claimed to have \"aced\" a simple cognitive test that is regularly administered to aging adults by geriatric physicians. During an interview with four reporters from the New York Times on Thursday, Trump allowed them to listen in as he conversed on his speakerphone with Colombian President Gustavo Petro. Afterwards, Trump made a point of asking the Times reporters if they thought Joe Biden \"could do that.\" This conversation took place days after Trump called Petra an \"illegal drug leader\" and a \"sick man\" and warned that he might be kidnapped \"next\" after he had kidnapped Nicolas Maduro and his wife from their home in Caracas, Venezuela. Trump is very determined these days. He is especially determined to bring the world to heel. He told the New York Times reporters, who must have been clutching the arms of their White House chairs in astonishment, that he doesn't \"need\" international law. Asked if there were any limits on his powers over the world, Trump responded, \"Yeah, there is one thing. My own morality. My own mind. It's the only thing that can stop me.\" Trump currently has one trillion dollars in his defense budget &#8211; I guess these days he would call it his \"war budget\" since he and Hegseth have renamed the Department of Defense as the Department of War &#8211; to fund attacks he wants to carry out on various enemies such as Houthi rebels in Yemen, alleged nuclear facilities in Iran, the Islamic State in Somalia, and more recently, 36 so-called \"drug boats\" in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean, and the country of Venezuela.

I've been doing something at night after I get in bed that I wouldn't recommend to anyone with a sane synapse in their head. I have been watching YouTube videos of traffic stops by police. Dozens of them. No, hundreds. They are, in a word, addictive. Cell phones and police body cameras have made this phenomenon possible. For the most part, the videos show what appears to be police misconduct. An officer will turn on the lights of his patrol car and pull an alleged offender to the side of the road. The offense can be anything from speeding, to failure to signal a turn, to failure to stop at a light or stop sign, to not having a current registration sticker in the window of a car. The officer approaches the side of the car and asks to see the driver's license and registration and insurance. Sometimes the officer will approach a car parked on the side of the street, or a car in line at a fast food drive-through, and ask for the same documents. Sometimes, the driver who is sitting in a stopped car will ask why he has to provide these documents when he or she has not committed a traffic offense. The police officer usually persists, telling the driver he or she must produce identification on demand. Sometimes the drivers are aware of laws on the books or court decisions that say you don't have to produce identification on demand when you are not accused of a crime. That doesn't work to defuse the situation. This is what happens in those videos, over and over again. The officer says \"Get out of the car!\" or \"Get out of the fucking car.\" When the drivers don't act fast enough to exit the car, the officer opens the door and forcibly drags them out of the car and throws them on the ground. These are very violent confrontations. Sometimes, the driver films it on their own cell phone. Sometimes, it is filmed by a passenger with a cell phone. Often, the film from a police body cam emerges during a lawsuit against the officer for excessive use of force. When it turns out that the",

Stephen \"Please make me look good when you take my picture\" Miller is Trump's chief saber-rattler when it comes to invading foreign countries we don't need to invade, such as Venezuela and Greenland. Miller attempted to justify what Trump wants to do in both places on Sunday when he told Jake Tapper of CNN, \"We live in a world that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power.

The answer is, not very. At age 40, Mr. Miller, you are too young to recall the time in the last century when the United States attempted to \"govern\" the country of Vietnam by strength and force and power. Here is a photograph of how that worked out for us. This is the iconic photo of the last rescue helicopter to leave the American Embassy in Saigon on April 30, 1975. It's not even an Army helicopter. It's an Air America \"Huey\" flown by a civilian contractor. Another helicopter, a Marine CH-46, came along soon after and evacuated the few Marine guards who were left guarding the embassy. More recently, in 2001 and 2003, the United States attempted to force its iron will on the countries of Iraq and Afghanistan. It didn't work. Here is a photo of the final American military cargo jet to leave the Kabul airport on August 30, 2021. That aircraft was carrying the last U.S. soldiers out of Afghanistan. These photographs are not stills from some Hollywood movie. They are not fantasies.

Every time an American president wakes up in the morning and decides this would be a good day to dispatch the American military to a foreign land for reasons of alleged national security masking plunder, it is traditional for the media, not to mention the Congress, to have a say about the matter. Neither the Congress nor our print media has distinguished itself. Both of our major newspapers, the New York Times and the Washington Post, took positions in favor of the Tonkin Gulf Resolution in 1964 which justified and authorized U.S. military involvement in Vietnam without a formal declaration of war. Both papers supported the disastrous Bush administration decision to invade Iraq in 2003 that was Congressionally approved by the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution. The New York Times ended up being sufficiently embarrassed by its coverage of and support for the Iraq war that the paper issued what amounted to an editorial apology in May of 2004. Yesterday's New York Times editorial on Trump's kidnapping of Nicolas Maduro and his wife in Venezuela can be summed up by its headline: \"Trump's Attack on Venezuela is Illegal and Unwise.\" The editorial hits all the right notes. It points out the hypocrisy of kidnapping Maduro to charge him with drug trafficking soon after pardoning the former president of Honduras who was convicted in a U.S. court of the same offense, and looks askance, to put it mildly, at the prospect of the U.S. \"running\" Venezuela while we avail ourselves of the country's oil resources. You may be wondering what the Washington Post has to say about yet another foreign adventure this time around? The Post's editorial headline says it all: \"Justice in Venezuela.\" You really have to read the whole thing to get the full flavor of the complete and utter capitulation by the Jeff Bezos editorial board to Donald Trump's dreams of profitable hegemony in this hemisphere, but the first few paragraphs give you enough sense of the thing to l",

The story underlying all others is that the United States Congress passed a law requiring the Department of Justice to release all the Epstein files-the files from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's investigation into the activities of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein-no later than December 19, and it has not done so. Epstein and President Donald J. Trump were close friends for many years, and the material the Department of Justice (DOJ) has released suggests that Trump was more closely tied to Epstein's activities than Trump has acknowledged. Although Trump ran in 2024 on the promise of releasing the Epstein files, suggesting those files would incriminate Democrats, his loyalists in the administration are now openly flouting the law to keep them hidden. Despite the clear requirement of the Epstein Files Transparency Act that they release all the files by December 19, to date they have released less than 1% of the material. Another part of the backstory of the past week is that the Supreme Court on December 23, 2025, rejected the Trump administration's argument that it had the power to deploy federalized National Guard troops in and around Chicago, a decision that seemed to limit Trump's power to use military forces within the United States. Yet another part of the backstory is that on New Year's Eve, Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee released a 255-page transcript of former special counsel Jack Smith's December 17 closed-door testimony before the committee. In that testimony-under oath-Smith said that his office had \"developed proof beyond a reasonable doubt that President Trump engaged in a criminal scheme to overturn the results of the 2020 election and to prevent the lawful transfer of power.

This new series in Journey to American Democracy comes to you thanks to that odd way history has of braiding the past and the present. Do you remember that in October the head of the Eisenhower Library in Kansas, a military veteran, was forced to resign after he refused to hand over to President Donald J. Trump a sword that had been given to General, and later President, Dwight D. Eisenhower? The man's name is Todd Arrington, and he told news outlets he was blindsided by the demand that he resign. He couldn't give them the sword, he told a reporter, because it belonged to the American people. But he and his staff worked with officials from the administration for two months to locate a sword that they could give instead, and found a replica Eisenhower sword from West Point. \"We felt very good about the way that everything worked out,\" he said. But then he found out that, after almost 30 years of service to the U.S., he was being fired. This is where the braiding starts. I knew Todd slightly from giving him some advice on his dissertation decades ago. We were on each other's radar screens enough that when a friend and I started the online magazine We're History a decade or so ago, Todd began to write for us, and later he helped us out by coming on board the magazine as an editor. After the magazine went on hiatus, we largely lost touch. But as soon as I learned Todd might have some free time on his hands, I plotted to bring him onto the Journey to American Democracy project. In our first meeting on what topics he might like to cover, fresh from his time at the Eisenhower Library, Todd noted that 2025 was the 80th anniversary of World War II's Battle of the Bulge. I loved the idea of covering military history in a smart way. And so we began this series last November. But now that the time to drop the videos is here, their meaning has changed.

Good was a white, suburban mother, whose ex-husband told reporters she was a Christian stay-at-home mom, and Bump is a white man. President Donald J. Trump's people see that demographic as their base. If it turns on Trump, they are politically finished, as finished as elite southern enslavers were when Harriet Beecher Stowe reminded American mothers of the fragility of their own childrens' lives to condemn the sale of Black children; as finished as the second Ku Klux Klan was when its leader kidnapped, raped, and murdered 28-year-old Madge Oberholtzer; as finished as the white segregationists were when white supremacists murdered four little girls in church in 1963. Evidence that President Donald J. Trump has sexually abused children would likely be enough to crater his political support from this group, making it no accident that the administration is openly flouting the law that required the full release of the Epstein Files by December 19, 2025.

(CHARLY TRIBALLEAU / AFP via Getty Images) On January 7, Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother and U.S. citizen, was fatally shot by ICE agent Jonathan Ross in Minneapolis. After her death, Good was subjected to a vicious smear campaign by the President, the Vice President, administration officials, and their allies. The baseless attacks against Good are a coordinated, brazen and callous government propaganda effort. The goal is to convince Americans to believe an official narrative over objective evidence - including video of the incident. It is an ongoing campaign to legitimize the homicide of an American based on misinformation. Meanwhile, the FBI is blocking state law enforcement from conducting an independent investigation while selectively leaking information to partisan outlets. Minnesota officials are calling it a cover-up. Trump: Good \"violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer\" In a January 7 post on Truth Social, Trump claimed that Good \"violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer.\" This is objectively false. Videos taken by witnesses show that the first shot into Good's vehicle occurred while Ross was standing in front of the vehicle as Good turned the wheel to avoid him. The second and third shots occurred while Ross was standing to the side of Good's vehicle . There is no evidence that Good's car even touched Ross, much less ran him over. In the post, Trump claimed it was \"hard to believe [Ross] is alive.\" In a video, Ross stays on his feet throughout the incident and is seen walking toward Good's car, which crashed, after the shooting. The Department of Homeland Security says Ross went to the hospital and was released, but there is no documentation of any specific injuries.

(Photo by Jim WATSON / AFP via Getty Images) On Monday, Popular Information reported that the U.S. military raid that removed Venezuelan President Nicol&#225;s Maduro from power could be a financial windfall for Paul Singer, a Trump-supporting billionaire. Singer, through a company called Amber Energy, purchased Citgo, the U.S. subsidiary of Venezuela's state-run oil company. The sale of Citgo was forced by creditors, including Singer, after Venezuela defaulted on billions in government-issued bonds. Citgo owns significant oil refining capacity on the Gulf Coast of the United States and other assets. An advisor to the court that oversaw the sale estimated that Citgo was worth about $13 billion. But Singer was able to purchase Citgo for a substantial discount, $5.9 billion, because those refineries are purpose-built for Venezuelan heavy crude. (The sale still must be approved by U.S. regulators.) The U.S. embargo on Venezuelan oil forced Citgo to purchase oil from more expensive sources in Canada and elsewhere. The U.S. military operation in Venezuela would benefit Singer if it meant Citgo could acquire Venezuelan oil. Less than a week after the military raid, Venezuelan oil is on its way to the United States. On Tuesday evening, Trump announced on Truth Social that Venezuela would be \"turning over\" between 30 and 50 million barrels of oil. The heavy crude will be \"brought directly to unloading docks in the United States.\" The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump's announcement was \"good news for Gulf Coast refineries that are configured to run heavy crude including from Venezuela.\" At the top of that list is Citgo, a company designed to process Venezuelan oil in the U.S. Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that Citgo \"may emerge as one of the biggest beneficiaries of President Donald Trump's plan to bring millions of barrels of the country's oil to the US.\" Energy Secretary",

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) In an extraordinary letter sent to a federal judge Monday evening, Attorney General Pam Bondi admitted that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has not disclosed more than 99% of the files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein - despite a federal law that required full disclosure by December 19, 2025. According to the letter, the DOJ \"has now posted to the DOJ Epstein Library webpage approximately 12,285 documents (comprising approximately 125,575 pages).\" Meanwhile, \"there are more than 2 million documents potentially responsive to the Act that are in various phases of review.\" The number of undisclosed documents has nearly doubled since the last DOJ statement, on December 24, which claimed that one million Epstein-related documents had not been released. The failure to release these documents is a violation of the Epstein Files Transparency Act , which was signed into law by President Trump on November 19. The law requires Bondi to \"make publicly available in a searchable and downloadable format all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials in the possession of the Department of Justice\" related to Epstein within 30 days. The law allows the DOJ to redact records that \"contain personally identifiable information of victims,\" material depicting child sex abuse, and other sensitive information. Each redaction \"must be accompanied by a written justification published in the Federal Register and submitted to Congress.\" Many of the limited number of documents that have been released are heavily redacted. One document that was \"released\" is 100 blacked-out pages . But the DOJ has not provided a written justification for any redaction.

Trump flags fly as rioters take over the steps of the Capitol on the East Front on Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021. (Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) Five years ago today, on January 6, 2021, a violent mob stormed the Capitol building. Following the attack, over a hundred major companies released statements condemning the insurrection and promising to stop donating to the 147 members of Congress who voted to overturn the 2020 election, or to halt all political donations entirely. Since returning to office, President Trump has continued to push false claims that the 2020 election was \" rigged ,\" \" stolen ,\" and filled with \" fraud .\" On Trump's first day as president, he issued sweeping pardons and commutations for some of those involved in the Capitol insurrection. In a presidential action, Trump wrote that the pardons and commutations ended \" a grave national injustice .\" The current members of Congress who voted to overturn the 2020 election have embraced Trump's return to the White House. None has expressed any regret for their vote. Nevertheless, most companies that pledged to stop donating to these lawmakers have broken their promise. After January 6, 2021, for example, a Cigna spokesperson gave CNN the following statement: There is never any justification for violence or the kind of destruction that occurred at the U.S. Capitol last week &#8211; a building that stands as a powerful symbol of the very democracy that makes our nation strong. Accordingly, CignaPAC will discontinue support of any elected official who encouraged or supported violence, or otherwise hindered a peaceful transition of power. Cigna, however, has since donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to lawmakers who voted to overturn the election. In April 2021, a spokesperson for the company told the New York Times that resuming donations to members of Congress who voted to overturn the election did not violate its pledge because congressional voting is \"by definition, part of the peacef",

Elliot Management Corporation's Paul Singer speaks during The DealBook Conference on December 11, 2014 in New York City. (Thos Robinson/Getty Images for New York Times) In a Saturday morning military raid ordered by President Trump, U.S. forces captured Venezuelan President Nicol&#225;s Maduro. After Maduro was apprehended and transported to New York to face criminal charges, Trump announced that the U.S. would \"run\" Venezuela for the indefinite future. The extraordinary attack, which legal experts said violated U.S. and international law , created a financial windfall for a prominent Trump-supporting billionaire, investor Paul Singer. In 2024, Singer, an 81-year-old with a net worth of $6.7 billion, donated $5 million to Make America Great Again Inc. , Trump's Super PAC. Singer donated tens of millions more in the 2024 cycle to support Trump's allies, including $37 million to support the election of Republicans to Congress. He also donated an undisclosed amount to fund Trump's second transition. This June, when Trump sought funds to bankroll a primary challenger to Thomas Massie (R-KY), who raised Trump's ire by supporting the release of the Epstein Files, Singer contributed $1 million , the largest contribution. Since Trump was first elected in 2016, Singer has met personally with Trump at least four times. \"Paul just left and he's given us his total support,\" Trump declared after meeting with Singer at the White House in February 2017. \"I want to thank Paul Singer for being here and for coming up to the office. He was a very strong opponent, and now he's a very strong ally.\" In 2016, Singer initially supported Marco Rubio, who is now Trump's Secretary of State. In November 2025, Singer acquired Citgo, the U.S.-based subsidiary of Venezuela's state-run oil company.

(Photo by Doug MILLS / POOL / AFP via Getty Images) On Wednesday night at 9 PM Eastern, President Trump delivered a prime time address to the nation that was aired by all major broadcast networks. It preempted the season finale of \"Survivor\" on CBS , one of the network's most highly-rated shows, the season finale of \"The Floor\" on Fox, and holiday specials on ABC and NBC. Typically, networks will interrupt their primetime schedule for presidents to address wars, crises, or very significant new policies. In his remarks on Wednesday, Trump delivered his standard talking points, bragging about his mass deportation policies and tariffs and attacking Democrats and the Biden administration. The only crisis was Trump's sagging approval ratings . \"Over the past 11 months, we have brought more positive change to Washington than any administration in American history,\" Trump said during the speech. \"There's never been anything like it.\" Trump blamed the Democrats for the increased cost of health insurance. \"You see that now in the steep increase in premiums being demanded by the Democrats, and they are demanding those increases, and it's their fault,\" he said. Millions of Americans will see their insurance rates increase after Republicans refused to extend government subsidies that will expire at the end of the year . The speech's partisan political content was not a surprise. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Trump would address the country \"about all of his historic accomplishments over the past year\" and \" all that he's done to bring our country back to greatness .\" Specifically, Leavitt stated that Trump would likely discuss \" border security and lower gas prices .\" The networks decided to break precedent and air it anyway.

Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law, has resumed his role as one of Trump's top foreign policy advisers - representing the Trump administration in high-stakes negotiations over Gaza and Ukraine. But Kushner has also continued to run his private equity firm, Affinity Partners. In 2024, armed with billions of dollars from Saudi Arabia and other foreign governments, Kushner inked a deal with the Serbian government to redevelop the former headquarters of the Yugoslav Army in Belgrade into a luxury hotel and residences. The building was damaged by NATO in 1999 during an aerial bombing campaign. The deal included extremely favorable terms for Kushner. The Serbian government agreed to grant Affinity Partners a 99-year lease to the property , which is a prime location in central Belgrade, for free . Kushner also had the option to convert the lease to full ownership at no cost. Affinity Partners would then keep 78% of the profits from the $500 million development, with the Serbian government entitled to 22%. In January 2025, shortly before Trump's second inauguration, Kushner reached a deal with the Trump Organization to brand the development as a Trump Tower. That agreement meant Trump would directly profit from the successful development of the site. There was one big problem: the property was designated a culturally protected site by Serbian law. It could not be developed unless the Serbian government changed its status. The deal struck between the administration of Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and Kushner required the Serbian government \"to remove the cultural designation of the complex and to complete demolition work of the existing buildings\" by May 2026.

Their son, Nick Reiner, who has struggled with drug addiction, was booked for murder and is currently being held without bail. Reiner was best known for his involvement in iconic television shows and movies, including All in The Family , When Harry Met Sally , and The Princess Bride . He was also a progressive political activist. Just hours after his death, President Trump attacked Reiner. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said Reiner's death was \"due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.\" According to Trump, Reiner \"was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness.\" Reiner was an outspoken critic of Trump.

US Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. during a Cabinet Meeting at the White House on December 2, 2025.

Already, 111 people, mostly in Spartanburg County, have contracted the virus. People have been exposed to measles at church, in health care facilities, and at schools. According to the South Carolina Department of Public Health, 254 people are currently in quarantine , including 43 children. Dr. Linda Bell, the state epidemiologist, says the measles outbreak is \"accelerating.\" Measles was \" declared eliminated from the United States in 2000 .\" But that is due to the effectiveness of the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine. In Spartanburg County, the immunization rate in schools is 90% , and many large schools have vaccination rates in the low-80s. According to the CDC , \"[o]ne person infected with measles can lead to a dozen other people becoming infected in any community where less than 95% of people have been vaccinated against measles.\" Measles is a dangerous disease. Symptoms of the disease include a high fever, cough, and a rash. In severe cases, the disease can cause \" blindness, pneumonia or encephalitis, swelling of the brain .\" Twenty percent of measles cases among the unvaccinated result in hospitalization and \"between one and three of every 1,000 children who get measles die from respiratory or neurologic complications,\" Forbes reported . Before vaccines became widely available, \" measles was the single leading killer of young children globally .\" As Bell noted, increasing vaccination rates now could slow the spread of measles in South Carolina. \"If people are willing to be vaccinated, receiving an MMR vaccine within 72 hours of exposure has been shown to prevent measles infections,\" Bell said .

A shame of modern America. How many Supreme Court seats were stolen, while Wall Street and corporate America looked the other way, to achieve this disgraceful end? Any corporation that has donated to the Republican Party and the Senators who voted to approve the Christian Fascists on the Supreme Court has to answer for this forthcoming decision. Corporations have power. It's its due time they pick a side. If they want a Christian Fascist nation, they should continue financially supporting the Republican Party. If they want a democracy, they should act like it. What the hucksters in Florida are doing with Disney the GOP will do to all corporations. If that's the business environment Wall Street wants, they should continue to play both sides. The wealthy may think all their money will be able to buy them freedom in the Christian Fascist nation, but they are only deluding themselves. Far too many in America gave into these Christian Fascists. Now, they have the power to rewrite American values for their deranged ends. If this opinion stands, the same reasoning could be used to overturn interracial and gay marriage, birth control, and countless other rights we now take for granted.

(Photo by Matt Cardy ) Before Trump's snatch-and-grab operation against Nicol&#225;s Maduro, I'd been noodling a take about how the invasion of Iraq, for all its many problems, seems to have worked out better than the invasion of Afghanistan. That's a bit of a vexing conclusion, because the war in Afghanistan was much better justified. The September 11 terrorist attacks really happened, the Taliban had long been sheltering Al Qaeda, and the United States invaded with broad global support and legitimacy provided by the United Nations. There's no such thing as a perfect war but, as far as these things go, this one was well-grounded conceptually. It just ended up failing in a pretty profound way, despite a solid casus belli and a perfectly reasonable war aim of \"set up a government that is better than the Taliban.\" The point of this, pre-emptively, was going to be to say that just because the burgeoning war with Venezuela was insane and unprovoked didn't mean it would necessarily be catastrophic. Trump seems to have been thinking along the same lines because, rather than coming up with any kind of plausible-sounding pretext or legitimate war aims, he appears to have focused on shrinking the mission down so as to maximize the odds of success. Rather than actually changing the regime in Caracas, he decapitated it. He now seems to be simply trying to stabilize the situation under the leadership of a successor group of autocrats who'll just agree to be more pliable to his demands, which center around seizing a slice of Venezuela's natural resource wealth. This is very much not what the Bush administration did in Iraq. Notably, though, it is something that many of the Bush administration's left-wing critics said he was doing in Iraq.

It is annoying that simple S/M/L/XL sizing makes it kind of a crapshoot as to whether any given dress shirt will have appropriate length sleeves for your arms and fit your midsection and also your neck. But if you go to Brooks Brothers or Charles Tyrwhitt (just to name two stores that exist in most cities), they size their shirts with separate neck and arm lengths, and you can get one that fits. Or you can go to Proper Cloth or another \"made to measure\" place where they'll sell you a shirt that fits exactly. Unfortunately, all of these options are a little more expensive than what you'll pay for a shirt that doesn't fit. But you either don't need to wear a tie very often, in which case getting one shirt that fits is not a major investment, or else you do need to wear a tie frequently, in which case you shouldn't be uncomfortable all the time. Thank you for your attention to this matter. lindamc: I read and listen to a lot of SB-adjacent stuff and I noticed that, at the end of 2025, quite a few take slingers (for example, those on Josh Barro's new podcast and a couple of UK/European substackers) expressed optimism for the next year.

On December 18, I published an op-ed in the New York Times arguing that Democrats should approach the American oil and gas industry more like successful center-left coalitions in Norway, Canada, and Mexico do with their own fossil fuel industries. That is to say, broadly speaking, that Democrats should invest money and political capital in trying to reduce consumption of fossil fuels - especially by promoting technological changes that move the needle on global emissions - rather than in trying to stifle domestic production. The argument is in part political. Mark Carney and Claudia Sheinbaum have totally different political styles, but neither thinks it would be viable to win elections in resource-rich countries while opposing their countries' natural resource industries. Jared Polis, Michelle Lujan Grisham, and Josh Shapiro are the governors of the three blue states where fossil fuel extraction is most economically important, and they all support their states' fossil fuel industries. And no one's going to win in redder states like Ohio, Alaska, and Texas with a stance that's to the left of Democrats in Colorado, New Mexico, and Pennsylvania. And since there's no path to a Senate majority that doesn't involve winning those redder states, the national party may as well stop banging its head against the wall of an impossible supply-side agenda and focus on what it can achieve. But my argument is also substantive. I genuinely think that a prudent approach to managing American fossil fuel resources is preferable to treating the oil and gas industry like cigarette manufacturers. Burning fossil fuels creates significant amounts of pollution, both particulates and greenhouse gases. This is a problem that needs to be addressed, but a genuinely prudent approach involves both holding the industry to a high standard in terms of things like methane leaks and electrification of the actual extraction operations, and then also pushing for the resulting cleaner fossil fuels to be ",

But it can be a bit challenging because it's such a fragmented landscape across a large and diverse country, where all the different layers of government oversee different pieces of the housing puzzle. And while I've been pleased to see housing supply emerge as a much more mainstream issue in the 2020s (at least more so than it was when I first started writing about it), one consequence is that there are too many policy initiatives for each to merit its own column, even though I still want to know about them and acknowledge the work.

That sounds like a silly thing to say, but what it means is that what the entire economy of China is set up to do - scale up high-tech manufacturing businesses - is something that only one man in America knows how to do. Only Elon has built China-like manufacturing businesses in America, and he has done it twice now - SpaceX and Tesla. When something like that happens twice, it wasn't a coincidence. Just to give you an example of how important this is, note that without SpaceX, China would be leaving America in the dust when it comes to space launches. But with SpaceX, it's America leaving China in the dust: Source: @kenkirtland17 One implication of this is that America needs to make it a lot easier to set up and scale a manufacturing business , so that our entire high-tech manufacturing sector isn't dependent on one slightly kooky right-wing billionaire. But that's a topic for another post. A second implication is that if we want to know about the future of physical technology, we should listen to Elon Musk . In fact, Elon has a great track record of seeing and entering manufacturing industries that China zeroes in on later: This is a good list, but it omits the most important items. The three industries that Elon zeroed in on very early, which made him much of his fortune - and which China has subsequently gone all-in on - are batteries, electric vehicles, and solar power . In fact, he still thinks these technologies are some of the most important in the world. In a recent interview, Elon said : It seems like China listens to everything I say, and does it basically- or they're just doing it independently. I don't know, but they certainly have a massive battery pack output, they're making a vast number of electric cars, and [a] vast amount of solar&#8230; These are all the things I said we should do here [in America].

He devastated Venezuela's economy by continuing all the worst aspects of the irresponsible economic policies of his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, reducing much of his population to abject poverty. He stole elections, suppressed dissent, and killed many thousands of regime opponents. Venezuelans are unlikely to mourn his removal from power at the hands of Donald Trump's lighting raid on January 3rd. And yet Maduro's capture has suddenly thrown much of the world into chaos and uncertainty. Trump ordered the U.S. Military to abduct a foreign head of state without Congressional authorization - a naked display of power in defiance of every international norm that had prevailed since World War 2. The geopolitical implications of that fact are going to reverberate a lot more than the abduction itself. A little over two years ago, in the aftermath of the October 7th attacks in Israel, I wrote that Pax Americana was effectively dead: The world is a more ungoverned, lawless place than it was 20 or even 10 years ago&#8230;The world is starting to revert into a jungle, where the strong prey upon the weak, and where there is a concomitant requirement that every country build up its own strength; if your neighbor is a tiger, you should probably grow some claws of your own. Old scores that had to wait can now be settled. Disputed bits of territory can now be retaken. Natural resources can now be seized. There are many reasons for countries to fight each other, and now one of the biggest reasons not to fight has been removed. In that post, I wrote that the end of Pax Americana was due to America no longer being able to carry out its function of \"world police\". Superficially, Trump's capture of Maduro might seem to imply the opposite. Trump had Maduro arrested on drug trafficking charges, which is pretty much the definition of a police action.

But the fundamental ideals are still just as powerful. \"You,\" Said Dr. Yavitch, \"are a middle-road liberal, and you haven't the slightest idea what you want.\" - Sinclair Lewis Imagine being a French liberal in the year 1815. You spent your youth dreaming of an end to tyranny and the stultification of the estate society, reading the works of Voltaire and Rousseau and Montesquieu and Diderot, talking of liberty with your friends in cafes. Yours was not among the names that history would remember from that era, but you once attended a salon in a rich woman's house in Paris. You were not part of the mob that stormed the Bastille in 1789, but you felt your heart leap when you heard the news, because you knew that now everything would change. When you read the terms of the Constitution of 1791, you saw the fulfillment of your youthful daydreams become the solid fabric of a new reality. Imagine, then, standing in 1815, a quarter century after the Revolution, looking back at what it had all become. That first bright rush of freedom had given way, first to the murderous insanity of the Terror and the Committee for Public Safety, then to the thuggish new imperialism and endless bloody wars of Napoleon, and finally to the fall of all Europe to conservative reaction under the Congress of Vienna. Imagine looking back on the arc of your beliefs, your movement, and your life, now as an old man, with no prospects for another, better Revolution ahead of you. Would you think your dreams had failed? Would you decide that everything you had believed had been an illusion, and that freedom, democracy, and the Rights of Man were false idols that led only to chaos and bloodshed? If so, you would be utterly wrong . The two centuries after 1815 would see the ideals of the early French Revolutionaries continue to advance across the world - unevenly, in fits and starts, and with many reversals, yet almost always leaving society better off than before. Those centuries would also see plenty of successors to Robespierre and Napoleon, but just like th",

Photo by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, via Wikimedia Commons \"The capitalists will sell us the rope with which we will hang them.\" In December of 2024, before Trump took office, I wrote about the disturbing possibility that the man once known as a consummate China hawk would sell America out to its great rival. I wrote that the key tell would be whether Trump dropped the export controls on chips and chipmaking equipment implemented during Biden's presidency: [T]here's one big important thing Trump could do to sabotage America's effort to stand up to Chinese power. He could cancel the export controls that the Biden administration placed on the Chinese semiconductor industry. Removing export controls wouldn't require legislative action - Trump could just do it whenever he wanted. And because the policy is not really in the limelight, there probably wouldn't be a popular backlash to its cancellation. So export controls are pretty much a pure test of Trump's China policy - if he keeps them, it's because he wants to stand up to China, and if he cancels them, it means he doesn't&#8230; [E]xport controls are doing what they're designed to do.

Chips are the foundation of all modern weaponry , from missiles to drones to satellites to advanced fighter jets. And AI itself, which depends on advanced chips for training and inference, is rapidly becoming an essential weapon of war. When autonomous drone swarms hit the battlefield, AI will become even more crucial to the military balance.

I don't have any podcasts for you this week, but an episode of \"Doom Debates\" with Liron Shapira will be coming out soon. 1. Why Abundance is good for small business It always seemed a bit silly that some of the antitrust people decided to start a rhetorical fight with the Abundance people. After all, market power decreases abundance (since there's a deadweight loss from monopoly). So theoretically these folks should be on the same side. But for whatever reason, some folks still insist on seeing a contradiction here. For example, Austin Ahlman asks how the Abundance movement will help a small businessperson trying to revitalize his hometown: And Zephyr Teachout asks what Abundance can offer to small pharmacists struggling in the face of competition from big chains: I don't sneer at questions like these; they are good and important questions. I'm a big supporter of small business , which I view as a pillar of the middle class, a provider of variety, and a positive force in urban politics. So I definitely want policies that support it. In fact, the Abundance idea has a huge amount to offer small businesses. For example, let's answer Teachout's question first. Pharmacies face a huge number of regulatory barriers. It's expensive, difficult, and time-consuming to get a permit to open a pharmacy. Renovating a space costs a lot of money and requires more onerous approvals and permits. There's plenty of laborious labor regulation that raises the cost of hiring workers. And so on. These costs function as barriers to entry for businesses. Big chain pharmacies like CVS and Walgreens can easily pay those costs and take the required time; in fact, they've already budgeted the costs in. But for small independent pharmacies, these regulatory costs and delays are a huge burden. This puts a thumb on the scale for the big chains, making it ",

But instead of publishing the final part as a fourth post, I figured I'd just publish the entire new section as a single post. So here you go! This is the entire new section of my book. It's about a big idea for how to partially reverse the economic stagnation that has gripped Japan since the late 2000s. Part I: I want the Japanese future back! Japan lost the future in 2008, not in 1990 When I lived in Japan in the mid-2000s, it still felt very much like \"the future\". 3g flip-phones with grainy cameras were far more advanced than anything I had encountered in the U.S. Japanese people had LCD or plasma TVs, while most Americans were still using old cathode-ray machines. Their kitchens had automatic rice-cookers and other appliances I had never seen, and their laptops were higher-performance and far more durable than the ones I had used in the U.S. Their toilets were like something from a spaceship, and their showers could dry clothing.

Photo by Look Studio on Unsplash A lot of readers tell me that my fundamental optimism about the world is one of the reasons they appreciate my blog. I think my usual sunny attitude springs from my above-average skill at resisting the negativity bias inherent in the media. It's very easy to read the news every day and conclude that the world is in a never-ending hydra-headed \" polycrisis \"; if you have a cool, detached perspective, you'll realize that things are rarely so dark. That said, this year I was a bit of a downer. The coming of the second Trump administration means the end of the era of stability that the world enjoyed after World War 2. Even if the U.S. can fix its domestic problems (which are not all Trump's fault by a long stretch), the ascendance of China and Russia as the world's dominant power bloc will not be so easily undone, and the ramifications of that shift are only getting started. That's what motivated the somewhat darker tone of my blog this year. But that doesn't mean I think the world is going to Hell in a handbasket. From India's resilient economic growth to Europe's timely rearmament to the ongoing technological revolutions in AI , electric technology , and biotech, there is plenty to be happy about. Even when it comes to American society, I see lots of quiet reasons for optimism. Our politics is dysfunctional and our media landscape resembles a demon-haunted wasteland, but underneath the surface, I see signs that our society is starting to knit itself back together after the unrest and chaos of 2014-2021. Health is improving. Violence is falling. Americans are starting to use technology more responsibly. Some of the economic sclerosis of the pre-pandemic years seems to be falling away.

In many places, Tokyo is the most-booked international flight destination: Source: United Airlines via Sheel Mohnot Some of this is because of transfer flights to the rest of Asia, but most of it is just because practically everyone in America - and the world - at large wants to go to Japan these days .

I did one in the 2010s, but it's totally out of date.) I myself will be there in early January. Anyway, the fact that everyone is going to Japan right now provides a perfect opportunity for me to explain how the world's love for Japan creates a key opportunity for that island nation to revive its sluggish economy.

It's dealing with tariffs and various other threats from an unpredictable and hostile Trump administration. And it's struggling with internal unrest over migration from the Middle East and Central Asia. That would be enough to keep anyone occupied. But on top of all that, Europe is being buffeted by the Second China Shock. The Second China Shock is another name for the flood of high-tech exports that China has been sending out around the world in the last few years. China's economy is still suffering from the prolonged effects of the real estate bust that began in late 2021. In response, Xi Jinping's government has unleashed the most expensive and wide-ranging industrial policy the world has ever seen, promoting high-tech manufacturing across a variety of sectors. Because the economy is in the doldrums, Chinese consumers themselves aren't able to buy all the stuff that their government is paying Chinese companies to make - electric vehicles, ships, machinery, and so on. So the companies are selling that stuff overseas, anywhere they can, for cut-rate prices. In Europe, that has manifested as a giant trade deficit with China: Source: Bloomberg This flood of Chinese exports to Europe is being boosted by several tailwinds. First, China's currency has gotten cheaper - partly as a result of China's weak domestic economy, and partly because the government has pushed down the exchange rate in order to pump up exports. Shanghai Macro Strategist writes : This combination - falling relative prices in China and a weaker currency - has made Chinese goods and services extraordinarily cheap in global terms&#8230;A vivid example: a night at the Four Seasons Beijing costs roughly $250, compared with more than $1,160 in New York.

(Photo by Timothy A. Clary / AFP via Getty Images) MANY OF US HAVE BEEN raising hue and cry about the irreversible damage Donald Trump has wreaked on the economy. Tariffs ! Corporate shakedowns ! Destruction of research institutions ! Deletion of data ! Politicization of the Federal Reserve ! Alienation of our allies ! Socialization of private companies ! And of course, the collapse of the rule of law . All of these things should be terrible for the U.S. economy, especially in the long term. And yet to date, the stock market has seemingly shrugged it all off . In fact, markets look somewhat ebullient. In 2025, the S&P 500 grew a solid 16 percent-far better than the average year, and better than many forecasts, particularly in the wake of Trump's Liberation Day tariffs. So what's going on? Why aren't investors pricing in all these risks? Some of it may be that they believe there's a huge, sustainable Trump boom just around the corner. It didn't come by the end of 2025, but perhaps it'll arrive this quarter . . . or next quarter . . . or the end of 2026 , per the latest goalpost-moving forecasts from Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. But there are other ways to interpret what's going on. None of them are particularly assuring: U.S. markets actually aren't doing that great, when compared to our global competitors. The lion's share of growth here in the United States-in both financial markets and hard economic data-is driven by a single sector: AI . . . . . . which looks an awful lot like a bubble right now. I find these explanations to be more persuasive than the hope that a new economic golden age is about to dawn. And to understand why, it's worth recapping why you should worry about the long-term damage from Trump's policies in the first place.

    "text": "The Law Is “Fake and Gay” Turns out the Trump domination theory of foreign policy applies to domestic politics, too. Before we start: A brief word about Jerome Powell. On the livestream last night I said that I did not expect markets to panic today about the consequences of Fed independence. As I'm writing, it's business as usual on Wall Street. No panic. Not even a lot of tangible disapproval. Why is that? I have a theory. Donald Trump is a real estate guy. All real estate guys want low interest rates. If you deal in real estate, low interest rates are good for your business no matter what else is happening. Ergo, Trump believes that interest rates should always be low. 1 You know who else loves low interest rates? Big Tech. For tech giants, access to capital is the most important thing and cheap money is what allows companies like Facebook, Google, OpenAI, Uber, and MoviePass to grow. When interest rates are high, speculative bets-like tech companies, which propose that scale matters more than cash flow-are much harder to sustain. Currently, the stock market is being propped up by Big Tech. The Magnificent Seven constitute 34 percent of the S&P 500's value . That proportion is a very large historical outlier. My theory is that a market beholden to Big Tech stocks is not going to be concerned about the political independence of the Fed if the result is return to ZIRP . Cheap capital is more important to them than the health of the bond market. This is part of my larger thesis about Wall Street's bizarre reaction to Trump, in which the stock market on the whole has performed way in excess of what the various economic indicators would suggest.

For his entire second term, Donald Trump has been grousing about Fed Chair Jerome Powell's resistance to cutting interest rates, but he has always stopped short of actually trying to run Powell out of office-until now. On Sunday, the Federal Reserve released a direct-to-camera video from Powell. In it, he said the Department of Justice has served the Fed with subpoenas and threatened a criminal indictment over alleged cost overruns for renovations at the Fed building. It's an excuse Trump has been using for going after Powell since last summer . In his video, Powell-who has gone about his business and ignored Trump's increasingly ominous rhetoric for a year-dropped all pretense. \"This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress's oversight role; the Fed through testimony and other public disclosures made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts,\" Powell said. \"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president.\" And here's the thing: No one is really disputing it.

(Photo by Brendan Smialowski / AFP via Getty Images) THE TIME HAS COME to get serious about impeachment. Donald Trump himself expects it if Democrats win the House in this year's midterms, and we've already had previews. Scores of House Democrats voted to advance impeachment articles against Trump last month, articles have targeted at least three of his cabinet secretaries, and a bipartisan pair of lawmakers is drafting charges against a fourth. The growth of the Trump-era Impeachment Club is due to the sheer mass of Trump courtiers and enablers piling up abuses. And while it's easy to be cynical or dismissive about these moves, the impeachment articles filed so far are not another round of politically weaponized vengeance. They read like simple statements of fact, the truth of what's happening right before our eyes. Practical or not, achievable or not at this moment in time, which of Trump's illegal, unconstitutional and criminal acts does not warrant impeachment? Who among his wrecking-crew leadership does not deserve the same? \"It's not a presidency,\" Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg has written , \"it's a crime spree.\" He said that less than a month ago, and the spree has escalated rapidly since then. I have spent the past year in the stand-down-on-impeachment camp-even though I wrote at Donald Trump's 100-day mark in April that he had already matched or surpassed all the articles of impeachment brought against every past president. Impeachment seemed futile to me at that point, although I conceded that \"later it might not be.\" My idea at the time was for Democrats to retake the House in the midterms and then move ahead with impeachment in 2027, with or without a Senate majority. Then came last week-the week in which Trump used U.S. military forces to oust Venezuelan President Nicol&#225;s Maduro and an ICE agent in Minneapolis killed U.S. citizen Renee Nicole Good in her car.

The judge's order came in response to a lawsuit filed by the five affected states-California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, and New York-and could be overturned either upon the resolution of the lawsuit or upon appeal, should the Trump administration choose to contest the decision. Friday's order does not affect another recent policy move by the administration relating to childcare: putting in place new administrative requirements with far tighter restrictions before funds can be disbursed, ostensibly as a way of combating fraud. In practice, though, this move will likely not noticeably reduce fraud but may cause delays in states getting childcare aid out the door. If one doesn't understand how the U.S. childcare system works, that may not seem like such a big problem-but the harmful ripple effects will go far, far beyond the directly affected families. Let's start with some background. The high cost of childcare-families using licensed programs often pay over $10,000 a year per child-is a result of the fact that it takes many adults to care for young children. Adult-to-child ratios are kept low (often one adult for every six toddlers, with different ratios for different age groups), which means fixed personnel costs are high. Even with many staff members making poverty wages, childcare programs often operate with paper-thin margins and little to no financial cushion. At the same time, lower-income families cannot afford the fees; the families of some 1.4 million children rely on federal childcare subsidy vouchers. This creates a precarious balance: When states have trouble getting voucher reimbursements out in a timely manner, or when subsidy funding is unavailable, childcare programs struggle to make payroll or pay rent and may have to close their doors. This scenario has playe",

First time reading? Sign up here . A month ago, California Gov. Gavin Newsom looked like he might be in trouble. Today, Newsom looks less like a political survivor and more like someone who easily flexed his political muscle to stay in office. When I first covered the recall election , FiveThirtyEight had California voters leaning to keep Newsom as governor by a mere percentage point. Folks on the left were already writing his obituary while criticizing the Democratic party for overlooking the recall and not taking the threat seriously enough. Meanwhile, the right had coalesced not just around removing Newsom, but around replacing him with Larry Elder, the most popular conservative on the ballot, a talk radio host whose following appeared to be boosting him in the polls. In the end, 6.1 million Californians voted to keep Newsom, and 3.4 million voted to remove him, a 63.7 percent to 36.3 percent margin. The question now is: What to make of it? No matter how much Democrats want this to be a sign of strength, I'm not sure it is. California Gov. Gavin Newsom. Photo: Gage Skidmore Yes, Newsom over-performed most of the polling. And yes, despite all the hype, he held off the recall effort rather easily. But Democrats outnumber Republicans by nearly 2 to 1 in California, and it took a visit from President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris; it took a media frenzy; it took a rotating cast of Democratic celebrities encouraging people to turn out and vote. It was clear, based both on how Newsom campaigned in the final weeks and how the Democratic party addressed this, that team blue broke a sweat. And in California, the momentum this recall had is not a great sign. This is a state Donald Trump lost by nearly 30 poin",

On August 29th, just a few days after a devastating ISIS-K suicide bombing killed more than a hundred people in Afghanistan, the American press began reporting a successful retaliatory strike. Here is the lede from a Reuters article that day: American forces launched a drone strike in Kabul on Sunday that killed a suicide car bomber suspected of preparing to attack the airport, U.S. officials said, as the United States nears the end of its military presence in the Afghan capital. The strike, first reported by Reuters, was the second carried out by U.S. forces in Afghanistan since an Islamic State suicide bomber struck the airport on Thursday, killing 13 U.S. troops and scores of Afghan civilians trying to flee the country. One U.S. official said Sunday's strike was carried out by an unmanned aircraft and that secondary explosions following the strike showed the vehicle had been carrying a \"substantial amount of explosive material.\" The official U.S. military story, which was repeated dutifully by much of the press in the ensuing hours after the strike, described a potential ISIS-K threat who had been seen loading explosives into his car, and had even stopped at an ISIS-K safehouse. We are now fairly certain, however, that this entire story is fiction. A Reaper MQ-9 Remotely Piloted Air System (RPAS) prepares for takeoff in Afghanistan.

Here are the most important revelations. Sam Altman spoke candidly and substantively about his plans for OpenAI in an hour-long conversation on Big Technology Podcast this week ( Apple Podcasts , Spotify , or YouTube ). And as we spoke, I started to get a picture of what OpenAI's future might look like. Altman was candid about OpenAI's plans to build deeper memory into ChatGPT, how it will handle more people forming emotional bonds with the bot, and when an OpenAI IPO might be coming. Following our conversation, here are seven big thoughts about OpenAI's strategy and where it's heading, starting with that memory feature: ChatGPT Will Remember You, And That's a Potential Moat For OpenAI Altman's vision for ChatGPT's memory is ambitious, aiming for the bot to remember almost everything about us if we choose. \"Even if you have the world's best personal assistant, they can't remember every word you've ever said in your life. They can't have read every email. They can't have read every document you've ever written,\" he told me. \"AI is definitely gonna be able to do that.\" If OpenAI is able to build \"infinite, perfect memory,\" as Altman put it, that could change the ChatGPT experience in a dramatic way. The bot, for instance, could remember decisions you consulted it on in the past, consider the outcomes, and advise you on current choices. There will be serious privacy considerations to wrestle with as well. But should the plan work, the switching cost to leave ChatGPT could be extremely high. Altman believes people will get to know an AI bot, invest in it, and then stick around. With memory, ChatGPT could have a lock in. Lots of People Will Build Relationships With ChatGPT As OpenAI improves ChatGPT for consumers - building in EQ and memory - many people are going to build relationships with it. Altman said he was surprised by how many people already want to form a bond with the bot. \"People like their AI chatbot to get to know them and be warm to them and be supportive,\" he told me.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told a room full of editors and news CEOs this week that OpenAI will prioritize selling AI to businesses in 2026. Altman lunched at Rosemary's Midtown with leaders from The Atlantic, The New Yorker, The New York Times, and other top national publications on Monday. The conversation, wide ranging and at times unwieldy, featured a charming and disarming Altman speaking candidly about himself, his business, and plans for the coming year. He even fielded a question about whether he felt like Oppenheimer from New Yorker editor David Remnick. Altman's plans for OpenAI's enterprise push was the biggest revelation from the lunch, details of which multiple people with knowledge of the discussion relayed to me. Under Altman, OpenAI has excelled at building consumer products, with ChatGPT approaching 900 million weekly users. But the company has faced fierce competition when selling its AI models to businesses, primarily from Anthropic , which is leading the enterprise AI market. At the lunch, Altman made clear that selling to enterprises was a massive OpenAI priority, and mentioned that it was an application problem, not a training problem, that the company needed to solve. Altman was straightforward about OpenAI's need to build better products for enterprises and his intent to fast track them.

Enterprise AI is the fastest growing software category in history, expected to bring in $37.5 billion next year , according to Gartner, up from almost zero in 2022. Should OpenAI make inroads in the category, it could more easily justify new funding rounds and better support its push to build $1.4 trillion of computing infrastructure in the coming years.

In a vacuum, the latest Apple executive departures were of little note. Apple user interface design leader Alan Dye and a deputy decamped for Meta this week, and longtime Apple watchers greeted the moves warmly. Dye, the guy behind Apple's controversial &#8216;Liquid Glass' operating system, was reportedly better at corporate politics than design, and his departure is set to make room for fresh sensibilities within the tech giant.

This week, it is especially hard to find any reason to smile. So we have decided to pay homage to a song of healing and redemption: \"Amazing Grace.\" The iconic hymn, meant to inspire hope in the wake of tragedy, has become a \"spiritual national anthem,\" though its roots are English. The lyrics of \"Amazing Grace\" were penned by John Newton, a British poet, clergyman, and slave trader-turned-abolitionist, in 1772, though it wasn't immediately set to music. The poem made its way across the pond in the early 19th century, and then American composer William Walker set Newton's words to \"New Britain,\" a traditional melody. The song quickly became an integral part of the American tapestry, sung by Christian denominations in all corners of the young country. It was performed at tent revivals and became an anti-slavery ode. During the Civil War, the song was included in hymnals given to soldiers. The song has been professionally recorded more than 1,000 times by singers as diverse as Elvis Presley, Jessye Norman, Willie Nelson and Mahalia Jackson. Jackson's 1947 gospel version of \"Amazing Grace\" received significant radio airplay, popularizing the song around the country. Jackson helped elevate it to a powerful anthem for the Civil Rights Movement, singing the song at the March on Washington and other rallies led by Martin Luther King Jr. It also became an anti-war song. Folk singer Judy Collins recorded an a cappella version in 1970, which became a certified hit. \"I didn't know what else to do about the war in Vietnam. I had marched, I had voted, I had gone to jail on political actions and worked for the candidates I believed in. The war was still raging. There was nothing left to do, I thought ... but sing &#8216;Amazing Grace,'\" Collins said. The popularity of playing \"Amazing Grace\" on the bagpipes can be attributed to the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards ",

Renee Good was murdered by an ICE agent on her way home from dropping off her first grader at school. Video from three different angles shows Good driving onto a street full of protesters and agents near her Minneapolis home. One can then see Good maneuvering her car at the command of several agents. According to eyewitnesses, two agents were yelling at her simultaneously and at cross purposes to turn around, back up, stop, and get out of the car. She rolled down her window to hear and speak with them. Moments before the shooting, she was inching her car forward. An agent, who was standing on the left side of the car, raised his gun and shot Good at point-blank range. A doctor in the crowd offered to help Good. The agent would not let him, saying, \"I don't care.\" Good was a poet and stay-at-home mom who was born and raised in Colorado. She has been described as a devoted Christian who was not politically active, according to her ex-husband's father. Her social media accounts appear to bear this out. Once again, the president and his lackeys are asking Americans not to believe what they see with their own eyes. Rather than console the family or condemn the violence, he orchestrated a fiction to cover up ICE's criminality, abuse of power, and the failures of his draconian deportation policies. Trump claims the ICE agent acted in self-defense and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem called Good a domestic terrorist who weaponized her car to target the agents. While die-hard Trumpsters might gobble that up like it's Thanksgiving dinner, the real story can be seen on the video taken by multiple bystanders. Share ICE stokes fear and heightens tensions rather than de-escalating them. Since Trump took office last January, four people have been killed and five injured ",

Credit: Getty Images For those who think Donald Trump is doing a bad job of running one country, imagine him trying to run two. Pity the Venezuelans who have lived under dictators for nearly three decades. Now they have an authoritarian-in-abstentia. Trump attempting to run the show from 2,000 miles away is a disaster in the making. If the president believes for a second that he can bully Venezuela, get ready for a reality check. The country is twice the size of California, has a population of nearly 30 million, many of whom want nothing to do with the United States, and won't be intimidated into submission. We've been here before, in South America and farther afield, with dictators arguably worse than Nicol&#225;s Maduro. But never with an Oval Office occupant as unfit as Trump. How long before American lives are lost? Trump out-Trumped himself on Saturday when he used the United States military to capture President Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores. They were extradited to New York and charged with drug trafficking and weapons offenses, making their first court appearance today. Trump did not notify Congress as is required by the War Powers Act, though, apparently, he did inform oil executives of his plan. Nor did Venezuela engage in any hostile acts toward the United States that would justify the use of military force. The legal, moral, and political ramifications of such an abuse of power will become clearer as Maduro and Flores move through the justice system and Venezuela reorganizes after the sudden and deadly U.S. aggression. This is what happens when an unhinged, amoral man with a massive ego and enormous power has no guardrails. During his first term, Trump surrounded himself with loyalists who did their best to save Trump from himself. This time around the sycophants, posing as Cabinet members, are trying to save themselves from Trump by greenlighting any outlandish idea that flies into his head. If they don",

He was a member of two of the most successful folk-rock groups in history: Buffalo Springfield and Crosby, Stills & Nash. He is a singer, a songwriter, a musician, a harmonizer, an arranger, and a producer. He has created rock, folk, and country music. He plays the guitar, bass, banjo, piano, and organ. He famously played every instrument on CSN's first album except the drums. Stills could also be wearing a birthday hat, because he turned 81 on Saturday. For all of this and more he is our reason to smile. Stills wrote dozens of songs for CSN. His last major hit was \"Southern Cross.\" In the liner notes for \"Daylight Again\" he described the song's origins. \"The Curtis Brothers brought a wonderful song called &#8216;Seven League Boots,' but it drifted around too much. I rewrote a new set of words and added a different chorus, a story about a long boat trip I took after my divorce. It's about using the power of the universe to heal your wounds. Once again, I was given somebody's gem and cut and polished it.\" I interviewed Stills, along with David Crosby and Graham Nash, a few years back. Stills talked about the music they made together. \"It's not so much that we were going to change the world. It's that we want to convince everybody that it's possible. And it's not so much that America's sick and dying, it's that it's a beautiful idea that needs to be nurtured. And we're about the joy of making a wonderful noise together.\" Nash went further to describe their \"wonderful noise.\" \"It was absolutely, completely a unique sound. It was one voice made up of three individual strains of voice. There was no doubt. We knew what we had.\" We are all glad they had it and grateful they shared it with the rest of us.

Instead, the president flat out got away with it. And now he will never face federal criminal charges for trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election or removing highly classified documents from the White House and hiding them at his Palm Beach resort. We've waited a long time for former special counsel Jack Smith to tell us what evidence he amassed against Trump. And now we know at least part of that picture. His recent matter-of-fact recounting of his comprehensive investigations only whets the appetite for the whole story. The famously tight-lipped Smith, who led two investigations into Trump and secured two indictments, testified before the House Judiciary Committee on December 17. Surprise! Smith's deposition, a robust defense of his investigations, was reported in the media. But The New York Times, for example, ran its piece on page A19 of the print edition of the paper, because the closed-door hearing was free of reporters and no video recording or transcript of the exhaustive eight-hour testimony was made available. Until December 31. After ignoring calls from Smith's lawyers to release the transcript, Rep. Jim Jordan, the chairman of the committee, decided to dump the 255-page transcript after everyone had gone home for the New Year. Smith, who was subpoenaed to appear, asked for a public hearing. Surprisingly, so did the president. \"I'd rather see him testify publicly, because there's no way he can answer the questions.\" Actually, he did &#8211; at least all the questions he was not barred by a Trump-appointed judge from answering. The reason for the closed session was that Republicans were concerned Smith would use the hearing as a platform to divulge heretofore unreleased information. Smith withstood a barrage of q",

A republic is a form of government in which power is held by the people, who elect representatives to exercise that power on their behalf. Our republic has survived civil war and world wars. It has withstood economic depressions and deadly pandemics. It has persevered in the face of scandals and political assassinations. For 238 years, the Constitution, buttressed by the rule of law, has been our bulwark against tyranny. But now we are faced with a cult leader-cum-authoritarian hell-bent on destroying it. As we look back on 2025, we're hard-pressed to find a corner of society more tormented than the American media. We have a president who is trying to disassemble an essential component of our democracy, piece by piece, reporter by reporter. It has been what might generously be called a terrible year for legacy media. So, Mr. Franklin, how do we keep it? We can turn to another Founding Father, Thomas Jefferson, for the answer. \"If a nation expects to be ignorant and free&#8230; it expects what never was and never will be.\" In other words, a republic requires an informed, educated citizenry. People kept in the dark can not simultaneously safeguard liberty. The freedom of the press is crucial to a democratic republic. That freedom is enshrined in the First Amendment and not by accident. If \"We the People\" do not know what is happening, we can not hold the powerful accountable. If the powerful are not held to account, we no longer have a functioning democracy. Share The powerful, who are acutely aware of how the truth can diminish their authority, are doing their damnedest to restrict and control the media.

She is 2025's ultimate reason to smile. Lennox is a classically trained pianist and flutist. She attended the Royal Academy of Music in London. Toward the end of her tenure at the school, she realized her heart wasn't in playing music. She left before she graduated and started singing and writing songs. At the height of her fame with the Eurythmics, she was tapped to sing a song for the movie \"Scrooged,\" a modern retelling of Dickens' novella, \"A Christmas Carol.\" Bill Murray starred in the dark comedy with a surprisingly sunny theme song. Lennox duetted with soul singer Al Green on the Billboard-topping pop song, \"Put A Little Love In Your Heart.\" I dare you to watch this video and not smile. I had the privilege of interviewing Lennox a few years ago. She is as charming and intelligent as one might imagine. What she had to say about the power of music has stayed with me. \"Music is the language of the soul, it's the language of the intellect, it's the language of aspiration, beauty, pain...human emotion.\" A perfect final thought to end the year.

Credit: Getty Images The story of Jeffrey Epstein and his sordid life, how he died and who helped him recruit girls and young women to abuse is horrific to contemplate and difficult to follow. That is by design. Those in high places don't want you to know the truth. And we have a president, and longtime friend of Epstein, who doesn't want you to care. But you should. With every slow-walked release of documents related to the case, more questions arise - especially for the victims. There are as many as a thousand girls and young women, all deserving of justice, and to know who was complicit in their abuse. If you haven't been paying close attention to the news over the last few days, good for you. But we all need to be up to speed on where this story is and where it is going. Much to the dismay of the president, it is not going away. Although the process has been haphazard, the information without context, and the release incomplete, it is a Christmas miracle that any of the Epstein files have seen the light of day, considering the Department of Justice is now an extension of the White House. After doing everything in his power to suppress the files, including getting Speaker Mike Johnson to send the House home and not seat a duly elected Representative for seven weeks, Trump lost. During the 2024 campaign, Donald Trump promised to release the Epstein files. He could have done it on Day One. He could have done it by executive order. Instead, he has denounced the content, deflected requests, and defamed anyone, including his own supporters, who pressed the issue. Apparently, Attorney General Pam Bondi didn't get the memo. In late February, she claimed she had the \"client list\" on her desk as she released 200 documents, ratcheting up excitement by labeling them \"The Epstein Files: Phase 1.\" Those files were anticlimactic, containing no new information. \"Phase 2\" never happened.

What she has done for journalism in the last two days is about as important, and courageous as it gets. With her cherished journalistic institution threatened, and her career on the line, Alfonsi is sounding the alarm that \"60 Minutes\" is sliding further into an increasingly irretrievable and dark place. The Steady team spoke to sources inside the broadcast today to find out exactly what happened when the new CBS News boss, Bari Weiss, spiked a highly promoted piece at the last minute. On background, we learned that Alfonsi and producer Oriana Zill de Granados had for months been working on a story about the Trump administration's illegal deportations of Venezuelan migrants to CECOT, a maximum-security prison in El Salvador. They interviewed former inmates about the brutal and torturous conditions inside the notorious prison. This is the place where Trump sent hundreds of Venezuelans he alleged were terrorists with gang ties. Human Rights Watch found that the 252 men were subject to \"arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance.\" As part of the reporting, they repeatedly asked the White House, the Department of Homeland Security, and the State Department for comment, but received no response. That is no surprise since this story would be another black mark on Trump's draconian immigration agenda. Last Thursday, after the story had been fully fact-checked and legally vetted by CBS lawyers and its Standards and Practices team, the piece was screened for a fifth and final time for CBS News executives. Weiss was supposed to attend but did not. She did, however, screen the story several hours later. At 11:50 p.m. Thursday, Weiss emailed the broadcast's executive producer, Tanya Simon, outlining a few issues she had with the piece that she called \"incredibly powerful.\" On Friday morning, Alfonsi made several changes to the script to address Weiss's concerns, believed it was",

Wicked: For Good ends on a bittersweet note, with its main characters, Elphaba ( Cynthia Erivo ) and Glinda ( Ariana Grande ), having been changed, well, for good.

That movie earned 10 Oscar nominations last year, including one for best picture, with wins for Tazewell's costumes and production designer Nathan Crowley .

Produced by Ankler Media executive producer of brand experiences Jennifer Laski, the series is presented by Apple Original Films & F1 . For filmmaker Joseph Kosinski , realism is paramount when it comes to making blockbusters - and it's clear from his recent output, including best picture nominee Top Gun: Maverick and last year's global smash F1 , that audiences agree. But for the Apple Original Films hit starring Brad Pitt , Kosinski, director of photography Claudio Miranda and the actors upped the ante. Shooting at actual F1 races around the world, the filmmaking crew often had less than 15 minutes to shoot one or two scenes at Grand Prix events ranging from Las Vegas to Abu Dhabi. In Vegas, it was a track that had \"no safety margin.\" If Pitt and co-star Damson Idris made any mistake, Kosinski says on the latest episode of Art & Crafts: Under the Hood , \"they would go right into a concrete barrier.\" During regular filming schedules, the actors and crew have 15-25 takes to get it just right, but at official F1 events, Kosinski would go to his cast and say, \"We'll probably get two takes, maybe three at this.\" He compares it to live theater - at a budget and scale much higher than any play. \"When you have the right cast, and you have the right crew, the pressure of those situations, I feel, brings out the best,\" Kosinski says. \"You have 150,000 people in the stands watching.

(CBS/Screenshot) Share Subscribe now The Golden Globes were a complete and total embarrassment. Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying this as a stuffy, sanctimonious believer that awards are things only legitimately bestowed upon artists by academies and properly credentialed critics groups. The \"legitimacy\" of any group to hand out trophies is more or less in the eye of the beholder. But once they are rolling, you can judge them by how seriously they take their project. Last week, I spent hours on the phone with a reporter from outside Hollywood who was genuinely trying to understand concerns about the Golden Globes. We went around in circles as she asked repeatedly: Aren't all these shows a bit of a joke? Can you really take them so seriously to get all upset about one of them? Every molecule of my body longed to agree with that&#8230; to just say, \"Yes! It's all a big silly joke! Who indeed, does care if the Golden Globes are corrupt and ridiculous?

TV isn't in quite as desperate financial straits, but the threats to it come from the same place and could ultimately be just as deadly.

Reuters photo by Leah Millis https://www.reuters.com/pictures/defining-images-jan-6th-capitol-attack-2024-01-05/ Five years ago was the insurrection. It was only a mile from my house. I watched it from my phone, with my children safe indoors and unaware. My daughters still don't know about the attack on the Capitol. They are at an age where it would be&#8230; difficult to explain, provoking far too many questions for which there are no satisfying answers. They know instead that Donald Trump is the President, and that we do not like him very much, and that we wish the other candidate would have won. My youngest asked recently how much longer he would be President, and I told her \"three more years\" with a certainty that she did not notice I did not feel. I find myself thinking today about an old essay I wrote. It was titled \"Afflicting the Comfortable.\" It appeared in an edited volume on the Media and January 6th . Academic writing proceeds at a glacial pace. I drafted the essay in 2022, as a contribution to a conference held on the one-year anniversary of the insurrection. I edited it in 2023, and the book was published in March 2024. As with much of my writing, the essay glances both forward and backward. It was, functionally, a warning left unheeded. Here are the bits that matter (mostly from the introduction, with a bit of the conclusion): There have to be consequences. If we are to stave off the next insurrection, it is essential that the people who planned the last one face social sanctions. If January 6, 2021, becomes a badge of honor or a pathway to profit and power, then we seal the collective fate of the nation. We can approach the problem of preventing the next insurrection from three main angles. We can focus on the mass public -the Republican Party-in-Electorate, a majority of whom now tells pollsters that they believe Trump won the 2020 election despite all evidence to the contrary. We can focus on ",

I was in a bit of a rut, and decided to see if I could write my way out of it. The plan ever since has been to write something every week, and just see where that takes me. This will be my 43rd and final post of the year. I took a few breaks to work on the book manuscript . Readership growth has tailed off a bit - I started the year around 9,000 subscribers, and will end just north of 11,000. Conceptually, I've noticed that my writing here has gotten shorter and more take-shaped. In 2022 and 2023, I was mostly using this venue to work through some big ideas that were destined for the book. I would spend several days per week trying to wrestle those ideas into shape, and the essays were usually in the 2,500-3,500 word range. This year, while I refined those earlier ideas into book-shaped form, my blogging was more focused on immediate reactions to political or tech news. They tended to fall in the 1,000-1,500 word range, written in a single writing session. That's&#8230; fine . But I'd like to get back to taking bigger swings in 2026. Professionally, next year is going to be an odd one for me. The book will be in production all year, slated for an early 2027 release. I'll be occupying that awkward liminal space where the work is done, and all that's left is the waiting. This has been my main intellectual project since the summer of 2018. I'm going to need to find some interesting ways to distract myself. I don't quite know what shape those distractions will take. I have a few ideas. Stay tuned&#8230; it could get pretty fun.

It will take decades to repair all the damage. I think 2026 is shaping up to be... better ? Not good, mind you. But certainly less-bad. Here are my hunches about the year ahead: Photo by Matt Walsh, via Unsplash: https://unsplash.com/photos/text-tVkdGtEe2C4 By late spring/early summer, Trump's governing coalition will be consumed by infighting. This won't lead to anything dramatic like impeachment proceedings or invoking the 25th Amendment. But one of the critical differences between Trump's first and second administrations is his ability to quell any intra-party opposition. Basically no one within the party network has been capable to stand up to him this time around. 1 They have purged the ranks of the DOJ and the FBI and the military. The sole governing value that unites the Republican Party of 2025 is we agree with President Trump . The ability to maintain that party unity is one of his few relative strengths. But, as Henry Farrell has argued, this sort of party unity is brittle. Absolute power can be a terrible weakness. Here's how it looks to me, right now: Trump's approval rating currently hovers around 40%. The macroeconomic situation is dicey. Neither will improve in 2026. And, as we draw closer to election day, Republican leaders are going to panic and start blaming each other. Trump's team will not deal well with dissension in the ranks, so things are likely to get out of hand. That infighting will be a blessing, because the more time they spend fighting each other, the less bandwidth they have for attacking the rest of us. This doesn't mean we are out of the woods yet . Russ Vought and Stephen Miller are going to treat this year like a clearance sale on consolidating their fascist power grab. The Supreme Court majority will be even more brazen in trying to lock in election-proof permanent majority status for the Trump regime. Still, assuming relatively normal el",

    "text": "On Hatereading as Method Ridicule is our last, best weapon I wasn't going to read Olivia Nuzzi 's new book, American Canto . It isn't, strictly speaking, in my wheelhouse. But I had some time available between the end of classes and final exam submission. And I do love a good hateread. My standard approach is to create a reaction thread on Bluesky, and treat that as the first draft of a proper book review. Then I trim it down and turn it into a book review that resides on Substack. I don't see any point in turning the Nuzzi review into a substack post though. There have already been plenty of sharp - witted review , appropriately cataloguing the book's failings. I don't have much to add beyond the hyperlinks. ( My review thread starts here , for my non-bluesky-addicted readers). Instead, I'd like to take a step back and discuss hatereading as a genre. Because I'm clearly enjoying myself with this, but I've never paused to think through what it is exactly that I'm doing here. This is the eighth hateread-thread that I've composed this year. It has become something of a running bit. (A couple people referred to me this week as \"Bluesky's Omelas child\" and ohmygodIlovethat.) The other books I reviewed were (1) Future Shock , (2) The Network State (far and away the worst book I've ever read) (3), Abundance ( Which I didn't actually hate, mind you), (4) After the Spike: Population, Progress, and the Case for People , (5) Boom: Bubbles and Stagnation , (6) If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies . I also wrote a thread about Alex Karp's The Technological Republic , but I didn't post a link to Substack and can't track it down now. What I look for in a hateread candidate is something that deserves it. The book has to have some juice. Most of these books come from Silicon Valley intellectuals, or from leading thinkers that Silicon Valley takes seriously. All of them tell us something about the stories that power elites tell each other. That's the main quality I look for in a hateread candidate: It has to punch upward. The other thing I lo",

    "text": "The end of optimization Some thoughts on a transition point in recent internet history, Here's an observation that, I suspect, has ceased to be true: There was a time period in recent internet history - call it the era of Big Data , or the platform era - when the large digital platforms (Google, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, Netflix) focused on optimization . The platforms had an immutable comparative advantage over their potential competitors. They had more data, more user engagement. They leaned on all that data and activity to refine and improve their products. (To be clear, the platforms still have more data and more user engagement than any potential competitors today. It's just that they don't bother to improve their products anymore. Optimization is so very ten-years-ago.) This was one of the themes in my friend and GWU colleague Matt Hindman's 2018 book, The Internet Trap . It is good to be an Internet King. Google's search results were better, and delivered faster, than its competitors. Netflix constantly fiddled with its recommendation algorithm, introducing customers to their next favorite show. Amazon could tell, based on your purchase and search history, what products to show you next. None of these services were perfect, but all of them were better-than-the-competition. Data optimization was a race to the top. The big platforms had a self-reinforcing advantage. And they took that challenge seriously. These same observations were baked into my 2016 book, Analytic Activism . I was studying digital advocacy groups, not tech platforms. But the fundamental behavioral assumptions were all there - the bigger your list, the better you could use data analytics to engage in \"digital listening.\" The challenge for activists lay in thinking carefully about theories of change, and making sure you measured and optimized for the right things.) I do not think we were wrong about these observations, back then. The research was solid. Matt's book won awards, and rightly so. But what I have now come to recognize is that the focus on optimization was a time-limi",

Part 1 in what I really hope doesn't become a series NOTE: I have a new piece up at Tech Policy Press , discussing the ways that the tech industry under Trump 2.0 differs from the tech industry under Trump 1.0. Here's the TL;DR version: It isn't that my 2018 warning was incorrect , so much as it now strikes me as dismally incomplete . What I had not counted on was that the tech platforms would be much more responsive to the demands of a rising authoritarian than they would be from pressure from their workers, or their users, or their civil society peers. A nervous monopolist is a well-behaved monopolist , but we are not the ones making the monopolists nervous any longer. Take a look . I think it's a good piece of writing. Okay, now I need to yell about two news items. Because it seems like tech companies are treating Black Mirror like a goddamn Pinterest board. Item 1: Last week, on the decaying husk of X.com, a former Disney Channel actor posted a 90-second advertisement for his AI company, 2WAI. The ad centers around \"Baby Charlie\" interacting with the avatar of his deceased grandmother. In scene 1, baby Charlie's pregnant mother asks avatar-grandma for advice. In scene 2, she asks avatar-grandma to tell toddler Charlie a bedtime story. In scene 3, 10-year-old Charlie talks with avatar-grandma while walking home from school. In scene 4, 30-year-old Charlie shows avatar-grandma an ultrasound photo, and she reacts with delight. And then, in scene 5, we see Charlie's mom recording a three-minute video with still-alive grandma, to upload for the avatar. Then the tagline: \"with 2wai, three minutes can last forever.\" I've written before about the social role of technology ( here , here , and here . It'll also be in the book). Advertisements like this are meant to build hype and garner attention, but they also present a vision of how a new technology fits into our social world. The 2wai commercial isn't in the same genre as Sam Altman and Dario Amodei heralding the coming age of Artificial Superintelligence. The product th",

    "text": "Every generation gets to recreate the environmental movement to suit its own purposes Some big-picture reactions to a recent NYT piece There was a big piece in the New York Times last week about the Sierra Club. Front page, below the fold, Sunday edition, written by David Fahrenthold and Claire Brown. The title tells you all you need to know about both the thesis and the tone: \" The Sierra Club Embraced Social Justice. Then It Tore Itself Apart. \" I served on the Sierra Club's Board of Directors from 2004-2010. I rejoined the board in May 2024. I will admit up front that, had I thought everything was going great with the Club, I wouldn't have run for the board again. But the article bears little resemblance to the actually-existing organization and the challenges it faces. Saying that the Sierra Club's problems are all because of woke is both entirely too trite and entirely incorrect. As I see it, there are three big-picture trends affecting the work of organizations like the Sierra Club today. All of them are tough pills to swallow. Each deserves grappling with. And none of them fit within the frame of the article. (1) This is a bad time to be the climate movement It sucks to be the climate movement right now. Like, if you had to choose a year out of the past four decades to be the climate movement, 2025 is, experientially, probably the worst of the bunch. And this isn't, for the most part, because of strategic decisions made by movement leaders or organizations. It sucks to be the climate movement right now because Trump won the 2024 election and went ahead and did all the things we knew he was going to do. We knew last year that Trump winning would be a catastrophic setback. We did what we could to prevent it. We were not, y'know, incorrect about how this would all go down. 1 The first Trump administration was bad too, but it at least coincided with the long-established cyclical burst of member engagement and donations. Trump 1 was structurally similar to Reagan 1. Your supporters come out of the woodwork when the causes they mostly take for granted are threatened. This meant that Trump 1 was su",

It makes perfect sense to me that the Senate Democrats caved last night and voted to end the government shutdown with only the vaguest of promises from Senate Republicans: I am a lifelong Washington Wizards fan. I am accustomed to watching my team throw away a lead. The vote is indefensible on the merits. The timing and politics are awful. This is the reason why practically no one who votes for the Democratic Party actually likes the Democratic Party. And yet&#8230; I don't ultimately think it will matter much in the grander scheme of things. The U.S. political system is just about irreparably broken. The Democrats were \"winning\" the comms fight over the shutdown, but that's a borderline-pyrrhic victory. Trump doesn't care about his popularity, and he doesn't care about Republican electoral losses a year from now, and he doesn't care about mass suffering and loss. The guy went to the Supreme Court with a demand that he let him starve 40 million Americans. That's both terrible substance and terrible optics! And still the theory-of-change here is \" well we hope that the electorate blames Trump and the Republicans for this, and keeps blaming them for another year, and then votes in such record numbers that they give the Democratic Party a slim majority in the House and Senate. \" That's the best near-term theory-of-change available. But I keep looking around and thinking \" yeah but that's not nearly up to the task.\" The government shutdown was pretty much bound to end this way. At some point, the squishiest members of the Senate Democratic Caucus were going to to get too uncomfortable with all the pain and suffering for their constituents. They were going to ask \"is this worth it for what we have demanded?\" And they would eventually decide \"nope, not anymore it isn't.\" The alternate possible outcome would have been Senate Republicans perma-nuking the filibuster. I personally think that would have been good, because the filibuster is antidemocratic and bad. But that mean",

Image via Unsplash: https://unsplash.com/@jpvalery A list of short reactions that I desperately feel the need to get off my chest: Elon Musk's trillion-dollar pay package . I mean&#8230; Sure, whatever. Matt Levine had a good take on this yesterday , before the vote. If you are still at Tesla investor in November 2025, then you are pretty much by definition an Elon stan. Tesla is a meme stock with a price/earnings ratio hovering close to 300. The new payment plan only kicks in if Elon transforms Tesla into a $8.5 trillion company. That's going to be hard to do, on paper, with declining car sales and an utterly pretend product line of personalized Optimus robots. People on Bluesky were saying last night that he'll never reach the pay package because it is a failing, flailing company. And I would like to agree with them, but I worry that these folks are underestimating the degree to which money - particularly stock market money - is all fake now. I think it's entirely possible that, over the next 5 years, Tesla sales will continue to decline, and the Optimus robots will be a Cybertruck-scale nonstarter, while, simultaneously, the company becomes a world-leading innovator in shady market manipulation and semi-fraudulent accounting techniques. By November 2030, Tesla might just be fifteen circular funding deals in a trenchcoat - cash-poor and on the verge of insolvency, but also nominally valued at $8.5 trillion, granting Elon his performance bonuses. Bookmark this for the next three years at least: it's only accounting fraud if we have a functional administrative state and courts willing to enforce the law. Hahahaha Sam Altman wants the U.S. government to guarantee loans for his AI data centers . Money is fake. Sam wants the government to guarantee that, if investors ever notice that his company is on the hook for $1.4 trillion in spending, with (maybe) $20 billion in revenues (WHERE'S THE OTHER $1.38 TRILLION SUPPOSED TO COME FROM, SAM???), then it will be someone els",

    "text": "Bill Gates's stunted political vision Bill Gates went full Lomborg. Never go full Lomborg. There is a stunted type of political vision that can only ever imagine the world getting better through the cognitive largesse of the power elite . This vision begins from the bedrock beliefs that (a) there is a social hierarchy, (b) it is basically meritocratic, and (c) it produces a rising tide that lifts all boats. The cognitive largesse can take two forms. (1) Geniuses can innovate, gifting us with new technologies or business ideas, or (2) Geniuses can make large, magnanimous gifts to the less-fortunate. If one buys into this political vision, then it stands to reason that you should never do anything to make the rich and powerful uncomfortable. Taxes and legal restraints and unions just slow them down and make them feel less generous. The path to building a better world necessarily runs through the better angels of their nature. (I wrote about all this in my 2020 essay about the Clock of the Long Now . It'll also be in the forthcoming book.) In 2021, Bill Gates wrote an entire book titled How To Avoid a Climate Disaster . He took seriously that climate change was a generational threat. The better angels of his nature were up to the challenge. And he indicated in the book that he knew this would be a long, hard slog. It has only been four years. By some measures, we have seen remarkable progress. The cost of renewable energy has plummeted. If we just have the political will to prevent fossil fuel companies from extracting market-bending favors, the trajectory of the energy sectors would look pretty damn promising right now. But the politics of 2025 couldn't be much farther from the politics of 2021, particularly in the United States. The Trump Administration has declared climate change a hoax. They are defunding scientific research and canceling already-existing clean energy projects. They are weaponizing the IRS to pursue political enemies, a list which includes the climate movement. And meanwhile, centrist pundits from the \"popularist\" school of thought have ",

In August, I said I was taking a one-month break. Now it's the end of November. During that initial break, I realized I needed a longer break, and then realized what I actually needed was a semi-permanent one. Subscriptions are still paused, and will stay that way. I'm putting this newsletter on indefinite hiatus while I figure out what I want to do next, and how the logistics of that change will work. When I know more on the logistical front, you'll know immediately. In the meantime (which will be a long time, and likely forever), you won't be charged again by this newsletter. I've wanted to move on from Substack for a while now, for many reasons. I've also wanted to move on from this particular project for a while. It's good to allow for endings, I think, and healthy to admit that nothing stays the same over time. Things run their course, fall out of relevance, and shift their meanings. They do this whether or not we admit that they do, and whether or not we're willing to live within the reality of those changes as they happen. The reasons for winding down this newsletter aren't anything shocking or momentous. Mostly, I just think it's time, and maybe past time. I miss doing other types of writing; I miss working with editors. I don't want my work to be defined solely by newsletter writing. There are other projects I'm interested in, and other goals to which I want to give my focus. I know there are only like four magazines left on the entire face of the earth, but I miss writing for existing outlets and working collaboratively, and I want to try to do more of it (on that note, if you're an editor reading this, and want to maybe work on something together, please reach out).

On a Saturday night at the very beginning of June, in a narrow basement full of old-fashioned uncomfortable seats, directly over top of a subway line that rattled the floors every time a train went by , the 7PM showing of Past Lives was sold out and the crowd was nearly feral. Kids, or people I understood as kids, piled in as though arriving at a house party. They carried snacks and drinks and huge bags and unfeasible jackets and extra shoes. They spilled popcorn, lost their phones in their seats, and tripped over themselves so lavishly it felt like it must be for show. School was out, but summer wasn't quite here yet. The previous week, college graduations had cascaded across the city's parks and subways and mid-tier restaurants. New grads in glossy polyester robes had clutched diplomas and flowers and tried to outpace their visiting parents trailing behind them. Then they left, or some of them did, and graduation season evaporated into the uncertain hallway between summer and life. May turned the corner to June. The heat settled down on the days. Air conditioners dripped heavy splats onto pavement. The college kids who hadn't left for new lives or vacation homes hung around downtown, done with one thing but not yet onto the next. Nobody knew what day it was; nobody knew if their life had started yet. Nobody knew what to do, so everybody went to the movies. By everybody, I mean every confused young person below 14th street, and by the movies I mean this one specific showing of Past Lives , at the Angelika at 7pm on Friday night. Or anyway that's how it seemed, as the auditorium filled up with chaos around me before the movie started. By the time the trailers began, I was convinced that not one other person in the whole room had ever been to a movie before. Couples had started making out before the lights even dimmed. Friends",

The air conditioning inside the Lincoln Square AMC is as big as a house, as big as a city, as big as a whole map. Movie theater air conditioning is a feeling about the mall and other people's cars, anonymizing and blank. Every movie theater is every other movie theater; I open the door from the street and I'm not in New York, but in America, its corporatizing vastness, its false comforts, its faith in an unbroken timeline. Outside the day whirrs and growls. Humidity sits down heavy as a bad news phone call. But inside a movie theater there's no weather, only slightly too much of whatever your body wants. In here, we're all pretending that we still live in the fuck-around century . We buy too many snacks and put too much butter on too much popcorn. Movies aren't cheap but they're cheaper than just about anything else, in this city, anyway. I've tried to shed so many versions of myself and succeeded maybe more than I should have, but who I was at this movie theater ten years ago and twenty years ago is who I am at this movie theater now, happy to be inside the air conditioning with a fistful of sugar and a faceful of light, wasting a slow afternoon in the cool and the dark, in the museum of the obsolete. The Lincoln Square AMC is objectively terrible and also the best movie theater in New York City or maybe the world. Most movie theaters are pretty bad, but this one is worse, which is to say, it's the best one.

Over the next few days, the publication will migrate to a new website powered by the nonprofit, open-source publishing platform Ghost . If you already subscribe to Platformer and wish to continue receiving it, you don't need to do anything: your account will be ported over to the new platform. If all goes well, following the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday on Monday, you'll receive the Tuesday edition of Platformer as normal. If you have any issues with your subscription after that, please let us know. Today let's talk about how we came to this decision, the debate over how platforms should moderate content, and why we think we're better off elsewhere. I. When I launched Platformer on Substack in 2020, it was not in the belief that we would be here forever. Tech platforms come and go; in the meantime, they can also change in ways that make staying there impossible for the creators that rely on them. For this reason, I almost launched Platformer on a custom-built stack of services centered on WordPress, the way my inspiration Ben Thompson had done for Stratechery . But Substack had some compelling advantages of its own. It was impressively fast and easy to set up. It paid to design Platformer 's logo. It offered me a year of healthcare subsidies, and ongoing legal support. I also felt a personal connection to Substack's co-founders, who believed that Platformer would succeed even before it had a name. They convinced me that I could thrive on their platform, and offered me a welcome boost in confidence as I considered leaving the best job I ever had to strike out on my own. In the three years since, Substack has been a mostly happy home. Platformer has grown tremendously over that time, from around 24,000 free subscribers to more than 170,000 today. Our paid subscribers have allowed me to create new jobs in journalism. I'm pro",

    "text": "Meta seeks to hide harms from teens But to change the conversation, the company will have to do more than tweak its settings What teens will see as Meta rolls out changes to Instagram. (Meta) Today, for a change of pace, let's talk about something other than the fate of Substack and all those who dwell upon it. Instead, let's look at the mounting pressure on social networks to make their apps safer for young people, and the degree to which both platforms and regulators continue to talk past one another. Let's start with the news. Today, Meta said it would take additional steps to prevent users under the age of 18 from seeing content involving self-harm, graphic violence and eating disorders, among other harms. Here's Julie Jargon at the Wall Street Journal : Teen accounts - that is, accounts of under-18 users, based on the birth date entered during sign-up - will automatically be placed into the most restrictive content settings. Teens under 16 won't be shown sexually explicit content. On Instagram, this is called Sensitive Content Control, while on Facebook, it is known as Reduce. Previously, teens could choose less stringent settings. Teen users can't opt out of these new settings. The new restricted status of teen accounts means teens won't be able to see or search for harmful content, even if it is shared by a friend or someone they follow. For example, if a teen's friend had been posting about dieting, those posts will no longer be visible to the teen. However, teens might still see content related to a friend's recovery from an eating disorder. The changes announced today fall broadly into a category of platform tweaks that could be labeled \"They weren't doing that already?\" But the fact that Meta made these changes, which the Journal calls \"the biggest change the tech giant has made to ensure younger users have a more age-appropriate experience on its social-media sites,\" underscores the degree to which child safety has become the most important dimension along which social networks are being judged in 2024. How did that become the case? The most consequential shift in attempts to ",

The company said this did not represent a reversal of its previous stance, but rather the result of reconsidering how it interprets its existing policies. As part of the move, the company is also terminating the accounts of several publications that endorse Nazi ideology and that Platformer flagged to the company for review last week. The company will not change the text of its content policy, it says, and its new policy interpretation will not include proactively removing content related to neo-Nazis and far-right extremism. But Substack will continue to remove any material that includes \"credible threats of physical harm,\" it said. In a statement, Substack's co-founders told Platformer: If and when we become aware of other content that violates our guidelines, we will take appropriate action. Relatedly, we've heard your feedback about Substack's content moderation approach, and we understand your concerns and those of some other writers on the platform. We sincerely regret how this controversy has affected writers on Substack. We appreciate the input from everyone. Writers are the backbone of Substack and we take this feedback very seriously. We are actively working on more reporting tools that can be used to flag content that potentially violates our guidelines, and we will continue working on tools for user moderation so Substack users can set and refine the terms of their own experience on the platform. Substack's statement comes after weeks of controversy related to the company's mostly laissez-faire approach to content moderation. In November, Jonathan M. Katz published an article in The Atlantic titled \" Substack Has a Nazi Problem .\" In it, he reported that he had identified at least 16 newsletters that depicted overt Nazi symbols, and dozens more devoted to far-right extremism.

Today, let's take a look at the one that hosts this publication: Substack. On Tuesday, I told subscribers that we are considering leaving the platform based on the company's recent statement that it would not demonetize or remove openly Nazi accounts. After Jonathan M. Katz's November article investigating extremism on the platform in The Atlantic , 247 Substack writers published an open letter asking the company to clarify its policies . A few days later, Substack co-founder Hamish McKenzie responded in a blog post . While the platform would remove publications that are found to make credible threats of violence - a high bar - Substack would otherwise leave them alone, he said. \"We don't think that censorship (including through demonetizing publications) makes the problem go away - in fact, it makes it worse,\" he wrote. \"We believe that supporting individual rights and civil liberties while subjecting ideas to open discourse is the best way to strip bad ideas of their power.\" McKenzie's perspective - that sunlight is the best disinfectant, and that censorship backfires by making dangerous ideas seem more appealing - is reasonable for many or even most circumstances. It is a point of view that informs policies at many younger, smaller tech platforms, owing both to the techno-libertarian streak that runs through many founders in Silicon Valley and the fact that a hands-off approach to content moderation is easier and less expensive than the alternatives. There was a time when even Facebook, which has more restrictive policies than Substack does across the board, permitted users to deny the Holocaust. CEO Mark Zuckerberg occasionally cited this policy as evidence of the company's commitment to free speech, even though it occasionally got him into trouble . Then, in 2020, Facebook reversed course: going forward, it said, it would remove Holocaust denial fro",

Today, let's talk about one of the biggest pieces of news from the break - and explore why the days of freely training large language models on every public website are likely over for good. The news, of course, is that the New York Times is suing OpenAI. Here are Michael M. Grynbaum and Ryan Mac : The Times is the first major American media organization to sue the companies, the creators of ChatGPT and other popular A.I. platforms, over copyright issues associated with its written works. The lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan , contends that millions of articles published by The Times were used to train automated chatbots that now compete with the news outlet as a source of reliable information. The suit does not include an exact monetary demand. But it says the defendants should be held responsible for \"billions of dollars in statutory and actual damages\" related to the \"unlawful copying and use of The Times's uniquely valuable works.\" It also calls for the companies to destroy any chatbot models and training data that use copyrighted material from The Times. First, a reminder / disclosure: I co-host the Hard Fork podcast for the Times . As such, I want to be clear any opinions here are my own, and in fact I'm not going to speak to the merits of the case at all - other than to say that I think the complaint makes for compelling reading. (Particularly the portions alleging that ChatGPT regurgitated long sections of Times articles verbatim after being prompted.) OpenAI, for its part, told the Times reporters that it had been in negotiations with the paper and was \"surprised and disappointed\" by the lawsuit. I'm interested in the case because I think generative AI has the potential to reshape the economics of journalism and the web to favor the builders of AI models over digital publishers. Already I find myself regularly looking up non-critical information via AI chatbot rather than Google , a habit that is generally faster than th",

And more \"The numerals 2024 set against a futuristic, utopian cityscape\" / DALL-E A year ago, as I sat down to write my predictions for 2023, two things seemed unusually clear. One was that Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter was disrupting the old order in social networking far faster and more dramatically than even his biggest detractors had predicted. The other is that the launch of ChatGPT just a few weeks earlier had set in motion a much more significant shift - though the scope of that shift would turn out to be much wider than I guessed at the time. Twelve months later, we're living in a changed world. Musk killed off the Twitter brand, along with at least half of its revenues, and drove more than 100 million people onto a rival platform built by Meta. And while the shifting fortunes of our biggest social networks continue to play a critical role in shaping politics, culture, and society, the speed with which generative artificial intelligence systems are improving now seem likely to prove even more significant. Over the next year, I expect to see both trends accelerating: on one hand, a once-in-a-generation realignment in text-based social networking that will further entrench Meta as the biggest player in the space; and on the other, the proliferation of generative AI into every digital surface that we touch, and much of the infrastructure that powers it. The trends will have their highest-profile collision to date in the run-up to the 2024 US presidential election, where platform policies and enforcement mechanisms could once again prove hugely consequential - for American democracy, and for the platforms themselves. Just thinking about it all is enough to make me want to go lie down for a couple weeks - which, upon sending out today's newsletter, is exactly what I intend to do. Before that, though, I have a few more thoughts on what we can expect in 2024, and Zo&#235; has some to share as well. In the meantime, thanks for supporting Platformer through a momentous year",

Late Monday, the jury deliberating in Epic Games' lawsuit against Google ruled in favor of the Fortnite developer. It found that Google harmed Epic by creating a monopoly in in-app billing and app distribution within the Android ecosystem, illegally tying the app store and its billing system together. A series of revenue-sharing deals with developers and device manufacturers were also found to harm competition. Epic's lawsuit was filed in 2020. Around the same time, the company sued Apple on similar grounds, claiming Apple's app store monopoly and ban on third-party billing systems was anticompetitive and illegal. But Epic ( mostly ) lost that case, which was decided by a judge. As this new trial unfolded, Sean Hollister wrote at The Verge , \" Epic v. Google turned out to be a very different case .\" He continues: It hinged on secret revenue sharing deals between Google, smartphone makers, and big game developers, ones that Google execs internally believed were designed to keep rival app stores down . It showed that Google was running scared of Epic specifically. And it was all decided by a jury, unlike the Apple ruling. Last week Hollister wrote a recap of the trial that, in addition to exploring the many facets of each company's arguments, serves as a highly entertaining account of Google's app-store related chicanery over the years: sweetheart deals to favored developers like Spotify and Netflix ; successful efforts to prevent third-party app stores from launching ; and the lies it told about its app store not being designed as a profit center. (The Play Store's profit margin in 2021 was estimated during the trial to be 71 percent.) And Epic managed to prov",

The move followed a poll he posted for his followers, in which a large majority of respondents appeared to vote in favor of bringing Jones back. Like many of Musk's decisions, this one appeared to have arrived on a whim, after someone tagged him in a post asking him to consider the idea. If the move was shocking, it was largely because Musk had previously ruled out the idea in the name of his firstborn child , who died tragically. By now there's no sense working up much outrage over which right-wing extremists Musk welcomes back onto X. It has now been more than a year since X's CEO declared a \"general amnesty\" for accounts that had previously been banned, resulting in the restoration of various white nationalists, QAnon affiliates, and others who had been booted from Twitter for good reason under the previous regime. At this point he could announce the returns of Cobra Commander, Skeletor, and Voldemort, and few of us would blink an eye. But Jones' original deplatforming five years ago stands as one of the most consequential cases of collective action among tech platforms in modern history. It's now been long enough that some readers have asked me, in good faith, whether Jones' case should come up for appeal. \"What's the case for indefinite bans on social media?\" one reader asked me over on Threads . \"In a world where big platforms are winner-take-all markets, handing out perma bans should be the absolute last resort and only be applied with very clear guidelines.\" It's a good question. To answer it in the Jones case, let's refresh our memory about the events leading up to his removal from Twitter and other platforms in the late summer of 2018. That year, the national media was nearing the peak of its interest in the platforms' role in spreading misinformation.

The board is making an effort to show that it can prove useful during an unfolding crisis. But given the speed and scale of the conflict - and Meta's cool reception to many of the board's recent ideas - it's unclear whether the result will go much beyond restoring a couple of posts to Facebook and Instagram. On Thursday the Oversight Board, a Meta-funded but independent body that is empowered to make binding decisions about whether posts on the company's apps should come down or stay up, announced it would take two cases stemming from the Israel-Hamas war . For the first time, the board said it would conduct its review on an expedited basis - meaning that its decision could come in as soon as 48 hours, and up to 30 days . (Regular decisions typically take the board about three months.) The first case selected today concerns an Instagram post: [It] includes a video showing what appears to be the aftermath of a strike on a yard outside Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. The content, which was posted on Instagram in early November, shows people, including children, injured or dead, lying on the ground and/or crying. A caption in Arabic and English below the video states that the hospital has been targeted by the \"usurping occupation,\" a reference to the Israeli army, and tags human rights and news organizations. Meta initially removed the post for violating its rules on violent and graphic content . The second is a Facebook post. [It] shows a woman begging her kidnappers not to kill her as she is taken hostage and driven away on a motorbike.

Google this morning announced the rollout of Gemini , its largest and most capable large language model to date. Starting today, the company's Bard chatbot will be powered by a version of Gemini, and will be available in English in more than 170 countries and territories. Developers and enterprise customers will get access to Gemini via API next week, with a more advanced version set to become available next year. How good is Gemini? Google says the performance of its most capable model \"exceeds current state-of-the-art results on 30 of the 32 widely-used academic benchmarks used in LLM research and development.\" Gemini also scored 90.0% on a test known as \" Massive Multitask Language Understanding ,\" or MMLU, which assesses capabilities across 57 subjects including math, physics, history and medicine. It is the first LLM to perform better than human experts on the test, Google said. Gemini also appears to be a very good software engineer. Last year, using an older language model, DeepMind introduced an AI system named AlphaCode that outperformed 54 percent of human coders in coding competitions. Using Gemini, Google built a next-generation version named AlphaCode 2. The sequel outperformed an estimated 85 percent of humans, the company said. Competitive coding is meaningfully different from day-to-day software engineering in some important ways: it can be both more and less difficult than what the typical engineer is asked to do. But still, the rate of progress here is striking. Gemini is natively multimodal, meaning that it can analyze the contents of a picture and answer questions about it, or create an image out of a text prompt. During a briefing on Tuesday, a Google executive uploaded a photo of some math homework in which the student had shown their calculations leading up to the final answer. Gemini was able to identify at which step in the student's process they had gone awry, and explained their mistake and how to answer the question correctly.",

Here is a quandary I find myself in: anal stimulation gives me intense, sometimes even overwhelming pleasure, and yet I rarely make the journey inside my sphincter unless there is someone else's enjoyment involved. It's like if your house was equipped to display a beautiful, brilliant light show, but in order to trigger it, you had to climb a rickety ladder into your attic and move a bunch of boxes and get high, high up on your tippy toes in order to reach the switch. So you figure, why go to all that trouble just for me? Best to save it for when company's coming. That's not quite right, but it will do for now. This is a quandary that has bedeviled me for years. Historically, it's been entwined with the desires - or, rather, lack thereof - of my partners. Somebody moves into your house and the light show doesn't quite do it for them, so you figure, \"Hey, whatever, we have tea and scones that we both enjoy, surely that is good enough.\" And maybe every so often you try to convince them that the light show really is something they enjoy, but that discussion takes so much effort that by the time you turn the lights on, they seem dimmer, less exciting than you remembered. Or you invite someone into your home and in their eagerness to explore your home they knock over a few vases and you start to worry that in their rush to enjoy the light show they might break the rickety ladder and bust up all the boxes and maybe even blow the fuse - and you just can't risk that kind of damage, so you just tell them that your house doesn't have a light show, you know? Okay, I think this metaphor has been stretched far enough. Anyway. Like I said, it's a quandary, and it's one that I've been living with for quite some time - actually, fuck, nearly two decades.

I was seventeen, newly arrived in New York City, and obsessed with Tristan Taormino, then the writer of a weekly Village Voice sex column, Pucker Up. Tristan was many things, but she was especially an anal sex expert, with a specific focus on helping other women find pleasure in their assholes ( she literally wrote the book on it ). My teenage crush on Tristan made me want to experience anal pleasure myself: when she released her very own butt plug, I bought it*, and used it to explore my own asshole, and develop a rudimentary understanding of my own anal pleasure response. So it is interesting, given those queer beginnings, how much of my imagination around anal sex revolves around men, and specifically cis men. To be fair, it's not just me: think about the last time you saw anal sex referenced in pop culture. I'm willing to bet there was a man, or the implication of a man, involved somehow. For starters, the most common way that we even discuss anal sex in the first place is through the lens of gay** male experience. \"Fudgepacker\" has a very specific connotation, and it's not about the joys of hetero assfucks. The purest distillation of anal pleasure is presumed to be one man sticking his dick in another man's ass, a penis meeting a prostate in an experience of mutual pleasure. Even when women enter the picture, anal is still presumed to revolve around men. A number of people can't wrap their heads around the idea that women - and especially cis women - might find anal stimulation erotic in and of itself; the anus is presumed too dirty, too taboo, to spark the feminine libido. Feminine anal pleasure is assumed to be about pleasing men : either through offering up our poor, prostateless assholes*** to amuse and arouse someone else's penis, or by going to town on someone else's prostate with a finger or toy or, if we're feeling brave, even a strap-on.

When we walk about anal pleasure, we often position it within a frame of active engagement - or, you know, getting one's ass fucked*. When I was reading The Surrender , it struck me as odd that even as Bentley waxes romantic about the first man to putt his penis up her asshole, she casually tosses aside mentions of other, earlier experiences of anal penetration. The fingers, the tongues, the vibrators that entered her ass: those are all written off as no big deal: it's the man whose member opened her asshole who she really wants to center in her story; it's the episodes of a penis penetrating her ass that warrant obsessive documentation. I don't particularly care for that framing, not least because it hews to this idea of the primacy of penile penetration that has shaped toxic notions like, ugh, virginity. While I certainly think that taking a dick up the ass is a different experience of anal pleasure than some of its counterparts, I don't find it helpful to position it as the pinnacle of anal pleasure or intimacy. I think it is just one way of experiencing the ass. If you follow me elsewhere - on Twitter, through my other newsletter, via skywriting - you may be aware that over the past few weeks I have had something of an&#8230; awakening? A mental readjustment - I came to the conclusion, first gradually and then extremely suddenly, that I am far more sapphic than I had really let myself realize.

I've been mentally exploring that identity** and trying to figure out how I understand myself as a thirty-seven year-old queer woman; how my desires and interests have shifted in the twenty-three years since I first acknowledged my bisexuality, how the various things that I have learned about myself in the interim translate to the person I want to be when I fi",

We were discussing this person's sexual predilections - as you do, of course, when talking to your friends - and I mentioned in the course of conversation that the person in question was very kinky. Curious to know more, my friend asked about the specific areas of kinky interest held by this individual. \"Well, anal,\" I initially responded. \"Anal isn't kinky!\" my friend replied. I have been thinking about that exchange ever since. I want to clarify here that when I described this person as both \"very kinky\" and \"into anal,\" my point wasn't that they were some hardcore fetishist simply because happened to enjoy a rousing round of some good old fashioned up the butt. In this particular instance, I was talking about someone who was fascinated with the more extreme end of anal penetration: systematic trainings and anal expansion and penetrative elements of an eye popping girth. But I still think this question of, \"Is anal sex inherently kinky?\" is a good one to ponder. Is it possible to be into anal and still totally vanilla? What does that even mean? In the strictest sense of vanilla sex - the normative, and heteronormative, variety where you're doing missionary in the dark with the person you're legally wed to - I think anal absolutely counts as kinky, or at least non-vanilla, sex*.

Well. There's a lot to unpack there, isn't there. I should start by saying that I don't purport to know whether or not being a survivor of childhood trauma increases one's likelihood of wanting to take it up the butt; I'm also, honestly, not particularly sure why that question matters in the first place. In the framework presented by the study's authors, it is important to assess whether this population is \"at risk\" of engaging in sodomy largely because of the adverse health effects that are associated with the activity; if we know that trauma survivors are more likely to be getting anally pounded, then the revelation that someone was traumatized in their youth means we should more aggressively screen them for that behavior in order to more diligently protect their health. Which - what? I mean, here's the thing: I would never deny that engaging in anal sex puts someone at specific health risks.

And I am, admittedly, at a loss to explain this phenomenon. When I try to come up with an answer, the first thing that comes to mind is that, well, I'm just kind of lazy? The thought of incorporating my asshole into my masturbation regimen feels like so much effort, particularly when there's another, easier orifice that will achieve enough pleasure to get the deed done, if you will. And in truth, it's not just my asshole that is left unattended: there are plenty of toys that gather dust when I'm on my own, all ma",

Apologies for being absent on this front for a few weeks but&#8230; [gestures at the general state of the world]. Been having trouble writing generally, and didn't think anyone really wanted an essay about some spurious connection between anal sex and COVID-19. Anyway. I hope you are well. I hope you are staying safe and social distancing. Let's try this again. There's a line in Toni Bentley's The Surrender that I am currently too lazy to look up and quote for you verbatim. The gist, however, is along the lines of this: the asshole - by virtue of its reluctant nature - is fundamentally more honest than the vagina. While the vagina might open up, lubricate, and let a guest in regardless of the emotional state or willingness of the person attached to it; an asshole is significantly more intransigent, resisting entry unless one is utterly, completely willing. The first time I read this line I was struck by a fundamental truth contained within; one musing on the difficult of forcing oneself to just lie back and take it. I have, regrettably, had times* when I wanted to want anal penetration more than I actually wanted it; in those scenarios, my ass, sensing my hesitation, did not easily give way, and, well, the episode did not end well. But the more I have sat with that line, the more uncomfortable it makes me. For starters, I do not love the idea of the body - and specifically the body's erogenous zones - as some unparalleled truth teller. There's an entire chapter of my book that takes apart the far too common belief that vaginal arousal supersedes the presence or absence of verbal consent: if I don't think that a wet pussy overrides a person's no, or provides the real prove of whether or not they want sex, it's hard for me to argue that the asshole should be anything different. Because, of course, the ugly endpoint of the assertion that the anus is incapable of telling a lie is the belief that anyone who successfully takes it up the ass must necessarily be doing it wi",

Spend enough time talking about anal sex - and especially queer anal sex - and you will eventually happen upon the word \"bussy\"*. A contraction of the words \"boy pussy\" or \"butt pussy\" (depends who you ask!), bussy presents the asshole as an inherently sexual orifice, a way of forefronting the ass for its erotic possibilities**. I'm not given to policing the words that other people find hot, and certainly, if referring to your asshole as a bussy makes your sexual experience more exciting, or if positioning your asshole as a pussy helps you mediate some kind of dysphoria, then I'm certainly not about to object to that. But I have to admit some hesitancy around the term, and more specifically around the idea that an asshole or a throat is suddenly a pussy simply because it is getting fucked. As a person who's spent her whole life with a pussy between her legs, my relationship with the organ is far more complicated and nuanced than simply \"this is the part of me that gets fucked;\" I don't love the idea that fuckability is somehow the inherent quality that makes an orifice pussyesque***. But there's also the fact that, on a very basic level, being fucked in a pussy and being fucked in an asshole are just very different experiences, and I find it strange to conflate them in this way. Certainly, there are some universal commonalities to the various experiences of being penetrated, but when I've spoken to cis men who love taking it up the ass, I've never really felt that their love of getting pounded up the rear gave them some inherent insight into what it's like to be fucked in one's pussy. When we have bonded over our bottoming, it has always been about butts****. I think it's worth questioning why an asshole or a throat would aspire to be a pussy in the first place, rather than embracing the fantastic, glorious experience of being the orifices that they are. A throat doesn't have to be a pussy to be a thrilling body part to be fucked in, and an asshole - with all its ma",

In a previous life, many years ago, I made my bones in a more traditional form of sex education. From my start as an HIV peer educator during my high school years in Buffalo, through some college volunteer gigs and finally a full-time sex education job with a New York City-based after school program, I did my best to impart accurate, non-judgmental, and supportive messages about sex and sexuality to every from elementary school students to senior citizens. By the standards of America's (admittedly abysmal) sex education programs, the organizations I worked with were cutting edge. We provided honest, fact-based information to our students, we never shied away from words like \"condom\" and \"birth control.\" When I worked with high school students, the curricula even included lessons on body positivity and consent: clearly, leaps and bounds beyond the \"just say no\" messaging that many people receive in abstinence-only programs. And yet in spite of how proud I was of the work I was doing, I knew, even at the time, that it was incomplete, even from a health and safety perspective. To be blunt: there was no way that I could educate my students about how to safely engage in anal pleasure - an omission which, let's be real, put certain groups of students at a bigger disadvantage than others. Oh, sure, I could tell them how to use a condom or a dental dam to protect themselves, and that knowledge would suffice regardless of what orifice was in play during their, ahem, play. I could maybe even explain that if you wanted to use a \"female\" condom internally for anal sex, that you would need to remove the inner ring before inserting it. But anyone who thinks that safe and healthy anal sex* begins and ends with barrier protection is kidding themselves. I couldn't really talk to my students about the importance of lubrication; I certainly couldn't talk to them about the importance of patience and not rushing things and gently opening up the asshole with a finger or toys.

    "text": "Monopoly Round-Up: Why Did Trump Just Attack the Fed and Corporate America? Donald Trump pledged to crack down on Wall Street ownership of housing, credit card giants, and defense contractors. And he attacked the Fed. It's the year of affordability. But is the agenda real? Lots of monopoly related news, as usual. Google is now emailing children to tell them how to avoid parental controls, a price war brought down the price of weight loss drugs, there's cool innovation by Lego toys, and the Trump administration actually blocked a merger! Before getting to that, let's focus on how Trump is managing the problem of affordability and politics. Over the past week, we got a clearer idea how this administration will set itself up for the midterm elections. The President announced attempts to crack down on credit card companies, big landlords, and defense contractors, and his administration is now pursuing a high-profile criminal investigation of the Chair of the Federal Reserve, Jay Powell. The moves are all happening, more or less, because of an increasing panic in the White House over high prices, as the President sees that the public is unhappy with his performance. In short, a key political theme of the next year for the Trump administration and the Democratic opposition is affordability, with a lot of rhetoric of cracking down on wayward corporations. Will it work? Is it sincere? That's the lens I'm going to use in looking at the events of the past week. To answer these questions, I'll observe another less noticed move last week that I find more significant. The Justice Department waived through a multi-billion real estate brokerage merger in what looks like a corrupt deal to create a home buying monopoly. Though few noticed this deal, it is one of many below-the-radar choices that will likely raise consumer costs. There is, in other words, tension between the announced agenda and the real one. From Make America Wealthy Again to Affordability Ok, let's start with the political context. The theme of the President's domestic economic policy in his first year was not affordability, it was, in Trump's words, Make America Wealthy Again . It is best summarized by this picture at the inaugural. There were some tariffs, and DOGE, but mostly Trum",

    "text": "The One Simple Thing That Makes the U.S. Economy Unmanageable We used to be able to answer the question \"How much does that cost?\" But prices in America are not only high, but increasingly hidden. Fortunately, there's pushback. In 1956, CBS launched a new game show, The Price Is Right, in its daytime schedule. Contestants were presented with various objects, and the one who guessed closest to the actual retail price would win. The Price Is Right became the longest running game show in American history, because it spoke to a very casual yet deceptively important social question: How much does it cost? There's an important political assumption behind that question, which is that every retail item has one single price. And any buyer anywhere in America can pay that price to acquire it. Americans might have had different amounts of money, but they were all equal in that they paid the same amount for the same good. While a single price in a market might seem a natural state of affairs, and economists love presenting simple supply and demand curves assuming as much, there's nothing natural about it. In fact, a dense network of laws and norms created the notion of a single price for all buyers and sellers in a market, aka, The Price Is Right society. We no longer live in such a society, because the legal framework behind a single public price for an item has fallen apart. There are many examples, but the easiest way to understand this change is to look at health care markets, where hiding prices, and the consequences thereof, is most advanced. There Are No Real Prices In Health Care A few days ago, Hunterbrook, a short-seller funded media outfit, released an investigative report showing what looks like a multi-billion dollar money laundering operation by the three largest health insurance companies. The allegation is that CVS, UnitedHealth Group, and Cigna are supposed to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies for lower drug prices for their patients. But instead, they collude with those pharmaceutical companies to force higher drug prices, and split the profits with them. It's not a new charge.

Plus, Mamdani takes office and billionaires rage at a wealth tax. Ok, so I was going to do a year end review and predictions issue today for the anti-monopoly movement, but yesterday, the U.S. engaged in regime change in Venezuela. At the end of this post, I'll have the usual monopoly round-up, with lots of news. But we'll start with the situation in Venezuela, about which Wall Street is very excited . The best way to understand what just happened is to start with history. Because while Trump is unusually explicit about his rationalization for seizing control over a resource-rich territory, U.S. domination of the oil reserves of South America is not new. And neither is the fusion of corporate and state interest. Ninety five years ago, in 1931, Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon, who owned Gulf Oil (now Chevron), forced the President of Colombia to give his company the Barco oil concession, which borders Venezuela. How? Well Wall Street banks and the U.S. government threatened to withhold vitally needed bank loans if Colombia did not cede the franchise. The parallels to the situation today are there. When Mellon seized these reserves, in partnership with JP Morgan banking interests, gunboat diplomacy was the norm. In the prior two decades, the U.S. had finished brutally putting down a resistance movement in the Philippines, and had become the global economic and political power after a gruesome world war. Woodrow Wilson had tried to establish a global rules-based order, which the GOP in the 1920s sabotaged. At the time, Democrats were incompetent and split, as it was an era of deep reverence for the wealthy and bitter culture warring over race and alcohol. For instance, the head of the DNC in the late 1920s, a Dupont executive named John J. Raskob, published a pamphlet titled \"Everybody Ought to Be Rich\" encouraging Americans to borrow money to invest in the stock market. Just as there is increasing support for cynical and nihilistic figures today, many in the 1920s felt warmly towards Mellon, Mussolini, and authoritarianism in gener",

And that might be why searching legal cases is so costly, even in the age of AI. Introduction Hi there! My name is Tom Blakely, I'm a federal judicial law clerk and attorney. I previously worked in big law and the United States Department of Justice. You might remember me from last year, when I wrote about the US v. Google ad tech antitrust trial at Big Tech on Trial . I'm excited to be writing a guest piece for BIG, this time on a particular competition problem I (and nearly every lawyer) deals with on a daily basis: the Lexis/Westlaw duopoly. The law in America does not belong to lawyers, it belongs to all of us. As citizens, we must be able to read the law, understand it, obey it, and bring complaints against those who wrong us. That is the basis for a coherent political order, and why the rule of law is such a foundational aspect of a democratic system. Moreover, it would be hard to find a technological era more suited to the democratization of law than the one we're in today. The computer lets anyone query instantly, the internet lets anyone do it from anywhere, and generative artificial intelligence can decipher and explain complex legal questions if it has access to credible databases. And yet, today, two powerful companies dominate and restrain access to key aspects of our legal order, from case opinions to legislative history. To give you a sense of what I mean, Lexis, one of two dominant legal research platforms, charges up to $469 for a single search. That's the equivalent of a Google query, for almost $500. Moreover, beyond LexisNexis and its rival Westlaw, the Federal judiciary itself has used its privileged position to charge high fees for court records that should be available to all. Today, the law is hidden behind paywalls. But it wasn't always this way. In this piece, I'm going to explain how and why America keeps the law from its citizens, and what we can do about it.

And they really don't like it. Is a genuine anti-monopoly revolt finally brewing in 2026? In the winter of 1932, during the depths of the Great Depression, a visitor asked Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis if he thought the worst was over. \"Oh yes,\" he said , \"the worst took place before the crash.\" Brandeis, who had predicted the disaster before it occurred, believed that the sunny lies of the roaring twenties had deluded the American people. The depression, as horrible as it was, as shameless were the business tycoons who caused the crash, was fostering a great debunking of myths. As a result, he believed, America would \"gain much from her sad experience.\" There's a misplaced belief that optimism about democratic politics is sunny and naive, reflecting of joyful circumstances, while cynicism is savvy and realistic, reflecting the grittiness of real life. The truth, as Brandeis knew, is the opposite. Disillusionment, a numbness to injustice, is the great villain of democracy. In the 1920s, after two decades of reform and a great war, the voters had become cynics. As one famous Senator, Hiram Johnson, put it, the people had become \"docile, and they will not recover from being so for many years.\" It was during that time of great cynicism that the imbalances and corruption unmasked in the 1930s built up. Only when the public recovered its ability to be outraged, to believe in collective action, that Americans could once again see their society as a free people and act upon it. The actual economic collapse started in 1929, and it continued and worsened even as Brandeis became more optimistic. It was the public learning and regaining its liberty that had to come before the material part could be fixed. Two weeks ago, I helped a colleague, an antitrust lawyer named Katie Van Dyck, prepare for a Congressional hearing on youth sports titled \" Benched: The Crisis in American Youth Sports and Its Cost to Our Future .

Things are going to slow down this week and next, since it's Christmas, but there was lots of monopoly related news this week. What looks like a fake sale of TikTok was announced, the FTC sued Uber, and a former FTC enforcer exposed private equity's role in youth sports. Before getting to the round-up, I want to focus on three events that unmask some behind-the-scenes villains in the Trump era, as well as the pushback that's happening behind the scenes. Let's start with the villains. As we know, both Netflix and Paramount are seeking to buy Warner Bros Discovery for $100B+, in order to consolidate Hollywood. Paramount owner David Ellison openly told Donald Trump he'll change CNN if allowed to buy the firm, in order to get permission to buy the firm. Netflix's CEO Ted Sarandos also met with Trump, and no doubt that plus antitrust lawyer Steve Sunshine's political analysis is why the Warner board agreed to sell to that bid. Well, a few days ago, the Wall Street Journal and Politico reported that both Netflix and Paramount are employing the same lobbying firm, Ballard Partners, where both Attorney General Pam Bondi and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles used to work. Ballard is the lobbying funnel for most major corporate deals under Trump, and has a strong whiff of corruption around it. Several Senators are demanding Bondi recuse herself. But basically, everyone in corporate America is openly saying they can use a fat envelope to overcome that pesky rule of law thing, and Ballard seems like the post office for these fat envelopes. The thing is, surrounding all of these deals aren't just lobbyists, but oodles of antitrust lawyers. Well-credentialed, well-paid corporate lawyers. Corporate lawyers who have all sworn an oath to the Constitution, to the courts, and to honesty and virtue in their representation of clients before the law, who are in good standing with the American Bar Association Antitrust Section.

It's about monopolies, Wall Street, and economists leading America on a path of destruction. A few days ago, consumer products company iRobot, the maker of iconic Roomba automated vacuum cleaner, declared bankruptcy . The CEO, a branding and mergers expert named Gary Cohen , sadly announced that the firm could not continue as a going concern. The board, full of lawyers and financiers but not robotics experts, voted to sell iRobot off to Shenzhen Picea Robotics, the Chinese company to which it had offshored manufacturing. There are about 20 million active Roomba vacuum cleaners in operation, and unless Trump regulators or antitrust enforcers act, now all the data harvested from our homes will go to China. The co-founder of iRobot, Colin Angle, was not introspective about this collapse, nor did he associate it within the broader context of the many firms who have had their technology transferred to China. Instead, he, like much of Wall Street, blamed the bankruptcy on Lina Khan. Why? Well she ran the Federal Trade Commission when it investigated Amazon's possible acquisition of the company in 2022, a deal the two companies ultimately called off. Here's Angle: \"I bet if you asked almost anyone prior to the blocking of the deal with iRobot: Would you rather see iRobot innovating like crazy, coming out with new and better robots for your home, or would you like to see it file for Chapter 11 in the process of being sold to a Chinese manufacturer?\" he said. \"The wrong thing probably happened.\" Many Wall Street dealmakers and foes of antitrust enforcement echoed this sentiment. For instance, former Obama chief economist Jason Furman, who is now the Aetna Professor of the Practice of Economic Policy at Harvard, used it as an example of the problem with populist economics. Blocking mergers, he believes, leads to destructive outcomes and national security problems. So is Furman right? This critique matters, because the goal here is to return to the economic statecraft of Bush and Obama, a time when the consensus was that concentrating capital would generate positive o",

Trump will be able to fire any political official anywhere in the executive branch, except for those at the Fed. That's&#8230; weird. Why? The stated reason, as Justice Alito once wrote , is that the Fed is not a normal part of government, it \"should be regarded as a special arrangement sanctioned by history,\" as it is a \"unique institution with a unique historical background.\" This rationale makes no sense; every regulatory agency is unique and and arose due to special historical circumstance. But of course, everyone knows the court has to organize its decision in a laughable inconsistent manner because it can't say the real reason.

    "text": "Secret Documents Show Pepsi and Walmart Colluded to Raise Food Prices Across the Economy The Trump FTC tried to hide a complaint showing Pepsi forced shoppers to pay higher prices everywhere but Walmart. But now it's unsealed. And the politics of affordability are explosive. Last month, the Atlanta Fed came out with a report showing a clear relationship between consolidation in grocery stores and the rate of food inflation. Unsurprisingly, where monopolies prevail, food inflation is 0.46 percentage points higher than where there is more competition. The study showed that from 2006-2020, the cumulative difference amounted to a 9% hike in food prices, and presumably since 2020, that number has gone much higher. Affordability, in other words, is a market power problem. And yesterday, we got specifics on just how market power in grocery stores works. The reason is because a nonprofit just forced the government to unseal a complaint lodged by Lina Khan's FTC against Pepsi for colluding with Walmart to raise food prices across the economy. A Trump official tasked with dealing with affordability tried to hide this complaint, and failed. And now there's a political and legal storm as a result. Let's dive in. Everyone knows the players involved. Pepsi is a monster in terms of size, a $90 billion soft drink and consumer packaged goods company with multiple iconic beverage and food brands each worth over $1 billion, including Pepsi-Cola, Frito Lay, Mountain Dew, Starbucks (under license), Gatorade, and Aquafina. Walmart is a key partner, with between 20-25% of the grocery market. Pepsi was also a key player in the post-Covid &#8216;greedflation' episode. \"I actually think we're capable of taking whatever pricing we need,\" said CFO Hugh Johnston in 2022. And the company did just that, raising prices by double digit percentages for seven straight quarters in 2022-2023. The allegation is price discrimination, which is a violation of the Robinson-Patman Act, a law passed in 1936 to prevent big manufacturers and chain stores from acquiring too much market power. The specifics in the complaint are that Pepsi keeps wholesale prices on its products high for every outlet but Walmart, and Walmart in return offers prominent placement in stores for Pepsi prod",

Dear readers, You've probably seen news this week about Cea Weaver, the rent-control activist Zohran Mamdani appointed to lead his brand-new Office to Protect Tenants. Weaver's now-deleted Twitter profile featured a lot of provocative far-left bangers circa 2019 and 2021, like \"elect more communists\" and \"private property including any kind of ESPECIALLY homeownership is a weapon of white supremacy\" and \"there is no such thing as a &#8216;good' gentrifier, only people who are actively working on projects to dismantle white supremacy and capitalism and people who aren't.\" Fun stuff! Weaver was also in the news last month, but if you don't closely follow housing policy debates in New York, you probably didn't notice. What she was doing last month might surprise you: the \"elect more communists\" lady who says \"homeownership is a weapon of white supremacy\" was getting herself to the right of our city council on various issues related to real estate development. In the waning days of the Eric Adams administration, the council considered various bills that would impose costly mandates on affordable housing developments (sometimes new construction, sometimes conversion of existing buildings) which the city spends about $2 billion a year subsidizing. These bills had strong support from the council, especially its most left-wing members - one such bill would require buildings to contain more units that would be spacious enough for families; another would require more units to be priced for the lowest-income tenants. But some Mamdani allies tried to discourage the bills' passage, understanding that these mandates would make projects more expensive for developers and therefore make it more difficult for the incoming mayor to deliver on his promise of more affordable housing. Weaver was one of the objectors. \"I'm worried about things that are extraordinarily well-intentioned but could make it very difficult and more expensive for the agency to get money out of the door,\" she tol",

Dear readers, Rose Horowitch wrote last week for The Atlantic about the explosion of disability designations at elite colleges and universities, mostly granted to students with mild and increasingly common psychiatric diagnoses like anxiety, depression and ADHD. Officially, 38% of Stanford undergraduates are registered as disabled, as are a third of those at Amherst and more than a fifth at Harvard and Brown. As the proportion of the student body that is designated disabled has climbed at these universities, so has the number of students who receive academic accommodations - most commonly, permission for extra time on exams. And while students who receive academic accommodations in middle and high school lag their un-designated peers in reading and math scores and are moreover less likely to attend college, this is not true for college students, many of whom had no history of such a designation before they enrolled in college. Horowitch cites the research of Robert Weis, a psychology professor at Denison University, who studies these trends: When Weis and his colleagues looked at how students receiving accommodations for learning disabilities at a selective liberal-arts school performed on reading, math, and IQ tests, most had above-average cognitive abilities and no evidence of impairment. And that, of course, gets at a major reason why so many students are suddenly \"disabled\" - it gives them a leg up, academically, in a supposedly elite, achievement-measuring environment. 1 A college education is supposed to both build human capital and send a signal about human capital to employers. The explosion of accommodations is one of several forces that are simultaneously undermining elite colleges' value on both of those dimensions: Admissions standards at many schools have gotten less rigorous. This is because many universities have made standardized testing optional for applicants; in some cases, colleges will not even consider standardized test scores that students vol",

We need more infrastructure - including fossil fuel infrastructure - to ensure that electricity is affordable. Dear readers, One issue that has helped Democrats in this year's elections is public dissatisfaction with electricity prices. Electricity prices in September were 5.1% higher than one year earlier, and the upward march of electricity costs under Donald Trump extends an ongoing trend from the Biden administration. Consumer electricity prices rose by 37.5% from January 2020 to September of this year, outpacing general CPI inflation, which totaled 25.2% over the same period. The cost of piped natural gas has risen even more sharply over that time - 49.3%. Since the start of 2020, consumer prices for electricity and natural gas have significantly outpaced general inflation, while gasoline prices have been volatile and have recently lagged general inflation. (Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics via FRED) When you're out of power, inflation is a good issue for you, and Democrats have capitalized on President Trump's failure to actually make life more affordable. But over the long run, Republicans have an advantage on energy as a political issue, because they actually implement policies that make energy cheaper. States run by Republicans tend to have much cheaper electricity than those run by Democrats: while consumers paid a national average of $0.18 per kilowatt hour for electricity in September, the average rate was $0.30 in New England, $0.24 in the Mid-Atlantic, and $0.32 in California . As a party, we should be nervous about the increasing salience of this issue, because we are worse than Republicans at delivering the cheap electricity that consumers want. To gain a long-run advantage on the energy issue, Democrats need to commit to providing energy that is cheap and abundant. That's going to require changing the way we govern, making it easier to produce energy and deliver it to consumers. And it's going to mean scaling back policies that intentionally raise the cost of energy in pursuit of carbon emissions reduction. Consider the situation in Connecticut, which",

    "text": "The Republican Health Care Trilemma Republicans want three things about health insurance, but it's only possible to have two, which is why they can't come up with a health care policy. Dear readers, Most Republicans, including the president, do not want to extend the enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that Democrats first enacted during the pandemic. But they also don't want to sound like they don't care about skyrocketing health insurance premiums. So we're back in yet another cycle of Republicans saying they're going to reform the health care system to make it much cheaper and better, and as always, there's really no plan - not even the \"concepts of a plan\" the president promised he had during last year's campaign. Instead, there's just a lot of complaining that health insurance is too expensive, and vague claims that Republicans can make it cheaper by unleashing the markets and consumer choice. Back in 2017, former House Speaker John Boehner said this about Republicans and health care: \"In the 25 years that I served in the United States Congress, Republicans never, ever, one time agreed on what a health care proposal should look like. Not once.\" Eight years later, that remains true, and here's why: (most) Republicans want a health insurance system that does three things - or rather, that doesn't do three things: It should not force people to buy health insurance if they don't want to. It should not spend a lot of taxpayer money subsidizing health insurance. It should not allow insurers to discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions. The problem for Republicans is it is only possible to have, at most, two out of those three things. In an unregulated market, you could have (1) and (2). It would suck for people with cancer, but it is a theoretically possible policy to enact. The trouble is with (3) - (3) is a rule that ensures that health insurance isn't a normal kind of insurance, and to make the abnormal insurance market work, you have to abandon either (1) or (2) (or both). The key thing to understand about health insurance is that if it worked the way auto or homeowner's insurance works, we would not be very happy. This is bec",

I've been getting some really interesting listener comments and questions since the launch of Central Air - a lot of them about issues I've written on extensively in Very Serious - so let's reopen the Mayonnaise Clinic. By the way, you can always email your questions ( on virtually any topic ) to mayo@joshbarro.com. ChatGPT image generation First, though my distaste for Gavin Newsom is well known, I admitted on this week's episode that I am increasingly resigned to the prospect that Newsom will be the 2028 Democratic nominee. Brian sent in this response: This podcast should have a pillar that it will do everything it can to spoil a Newsom nomination. I say this as a Californian. He cannot be the nominee. We will lose by a million. It has to be a Shapiro or Whitmer type. Look, Newsom continues to be far from my first choice. I don't think he would put our party's best foot forward to swing voters. I want Josh Shapiro to be the nominee, and I also think Gretchen Whitmer would be a strong choice. Pete Buttigieg might be fine, too, though I continue to worry about his lack of an electoral track record beyond South Bend. But when I look back at my screed about Newsom from 2022 , I mostly cringe about having scolded him for flirting with a 2024 presidential run at a time when Joe Biden was on a course to run again. Oops! Gavin Newsom was on to something, and I didn't give him the credit he deserved! So maybe I should consider whether I also owe him credit in other areas. As I said on the show this week, Democratic voters are hungry for the party to \"fight back\" against Trump, which is awkward, because Democrats are in the minority in Congress and have few good tools to fight back. Newsom, to his credit, found a good tool: He is leading a likely successful effort to redraw California's congressional district maps and offset the effects of the redistricting the president demanded in Texas.

Dear readers, The good people at Welcome 1 have put out their \"Deciding to Win\" report , consolidating their opinion research-driven advice on how the party can effectively moderate in a way that will win over voters who have decided the Democratic Party has grown too extreme and out of touch. If you're a reader of this newsletter, you're probably already bought in on the idea that the recommendations in the report are worth following. Their advice breaks down into five main recommendations, listed in the report's executive summary , but I want to focus today on the third recommendation: \"Convince voters that we share their priorities by focusing more on issues voters do not think our party prioritizes highly enough (the economy, the cost of living, health care, border security, public safety), and focusing less on issues voters think we place too much emphasis on (climate change, democracy, abortion, identity and cultural issues).\" Democratic candidates, of course, do not generally go into elections saying \"we think climate change and cultural issues are more important than the cost of living and public safety.\" Paid media (candidate- or PAC-funded ads) in Democratic campaigns tends to focus heavily on issues voters rate as highly important and urgent, like the economy and health care. In the New York area, successful Democratic congressional candidates in 2024 ran ads touting their get-tough positions on crime and immigration. But Democrats generally (and Kamala Harris specifically) have been dogged by the perception that, with the exception of health care, they're not focused on the same issues Americans are, and instead are fixated on climate change and L.G.B.T. issues, which voters rate as low-priority. It is already going to be a challenge for Democrats to change voters' views about where the party stands on issues. But convincing voters to change their perception of which issues are important to Democrats seems even harder. If I'm a Democrat running for offic",

    "text": "Democrats Need to Re-Learn the Valid Reasons to Restrict Immigration It's not just parochialism or bad economics, let alone bigotry - our fellow citizens have good reasons to oppose uncontrolled migration. This morning, the New York Times published my roundtable conversation with Nicole Gelinas and Mara Gay about the latest New York City mayoral debate. You can check it out here . Dear readers, Matt Yglesias wrote another piece earlier this week trying to understand exactly why the Biden administration went so wrong on immigration, and in it, he offers this helpfully reflective explanation for why Democrats struggle to offer coherent, effective immigration policy, while Republicans enjoy voters' enduring trust to handle it. He writes: The voters believe, accurately, that elite liberals - including fairly moderate ones like me - are uncomfortable with the idea of being mean to sympathetic immigration cases. And even if some of these voters are absolutely convinced that Trump is going too far on immigration, they're also worried that putting soft-hearted Democrats in charge will lead to disaster. Which, after all, is what happened when Joe Biden was president. It's difficult to convincingly argue that your party will handle a problem when it's made up of people who don't think the problem is a problem. And most Democrats simply don't recognize a large number of illegal immigrants as a problem, except to the extent that it is a political problem because other Americans consider it to be a problem. This includes Matt himself, who - despite his understanding that Democrats must urgently move in a pro-enforcement direction on immigration to win elections - says he feels \"ick\" about people who choose to work in immigration enforcement, because \"making a career out of locking up and deporting people, most of whom aren't hurting anyone, is weird.\" The default sympathy expressed here (and more broadly in the party) is a big problem for restoring trust in Democrats on the issue. In order to rectify this, Democrats need to re-think and re-direct this sympathy; they need to get back in touch with the reasons that both uncontrolled migration and excessive volumes of migration reall",

    "text": "Why Aren't We All Trying to Find the Guy Who Did This (Screwed Up Immigration Under Biden)? So, who was it? Dear readers, I wrote for The New York Times last week about how the Democratic Party needs a reset on immigration. The Biden administration's loss of control over both the southern border and the asylum system caused the number of illegal immigrants in the country to soar by millions, ruining our party's credibility on the issue. And so even as President Trump's poll numbers on immigration have softened, poll respondents remain much more likely to say they trust Republicans to handle the issue than Democrats. It wasn't always like this. In June 2013 , 48% of respondents told Gallup they thought Democrats were closer to their own views on immigration; 36% said Republicans shared their views. 1 Not coincidentally, Barack Obama took a lot of attacks from his left for being the \"Deporter-in-Chief.\" The implication is clear: When Democrats are seen as willing to enforce immigration law and deport illegal immigrants, voters will trust us to set immigration policy. To start to win back voters' trust, the party must acknowledge that the Biden administration ' s policy of laxity was a failure, and commit credibly to better enforcement - not only by preventing illegal border crossings and closing the loopholes in the asylum system, but also by enforcing immigration law in the interior of the country, by deporting people who weren't supposed to come here during Biden's term. Democrats have lots of criticisms of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement approach - and polls show some of those criticisms are shared by voters - but when Democrats criticize the administration, they should talk about what they would do instead to prevent illegal immigration and reduce the population of illegal immigrants. If Democrats are only seen talking about how the government is doing too much enforcement, we'll be seen as the anti-enforcement party, and that's politically deadly.

These installations are simple and routine enough that building superintendents typically handle them now. In the rest of the country, if you buy your new gas appliance from a big box retailer, the person who delivers it will also install it - here's the Home Depot explaining how their non-plumber technician will install your gas range for you . New York landlords are warning that this new rule will increase costs - hundreds of dollars to install an appliance, which will ultimately flow through to rents - and also cause delays for tenants in need of new appliances. In New York City, there are only about 1,000 master plumbers available to service 2.3 million rental units . But the trade association for master plumbers in New York has argued strenuously that this work should be reserved to master plumbers for safety reasons , and now the council has overwhelmingly agreed. This sort of thing is why it's so expensive to live in New York. We are burdened with a zillion little regulations that all have their own arguments for why they're a good idea, but that ultimately make everything we do cost more than in a less regulated jurisdiction. (The festooning of our beautiful city with protective scaffolding, supposedly necessary for safety and yet suspiciously absent in similar cities like Chicago, is another key example.) The 47-1 vote reflects the power that a constituency like the plumbers have - progressive Democrats like them because they're a labor group, while Republicans and conservative Democrats see them as their kind of labor group.

    "text": "How Much Power Does the President Actually Have Over the Civil Service? More than you think, which is why other branches need to step up Photograph by Doug Mills / NYT / Redux For the last century, a comforting piece of conventional wisdom has shaped debates about American governance: civil service laws insulate federal employees from presidential politics by promoting merit over politics in hiring, retention, and removal. Career officials may frustrate presidents. They may be slow, risk-averse, or resistant to change. But they are protected-by law, by norms, and by institutions-from being reshaped wholesale at the whim of whoever occupies the White House. In Presidential Control of the Civil Service , I argue that this assumption is wrong. Presidents possess far more legal authority over the federal workforce than most scholars, journalists, and even many public servants realize. That authority is not constitutionally derived. It is statutory-and it has existed for more than a century. The result is a civil service whose structure, capacity, and independence are far more contingent on presidential character and priorities than our theories of governance usually acknowledge. Can We Still Govern? is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. The Blind Spot in How We Think About Presidential Power In law, discussions of presidential control tend to focus on constitutional flashpoints: the removal of principal officers, the unitary executive theory, or high-profile Supreme Court cases. Meanwhile, public administration scholars have documented a quieter reality: presidents shape the federal workforce through their management agendas. These two literatures have largely talked past each other. Legal scholars often assume presidents lack meaningful authority over the rank-and-file civil service. Public administration scholars document presidential influence but frequently treat it as informal, political, or extralegal. The missing link is statutory law.

It felt a bit like a student who can't decide which spring break photos look cutest, so they just upload them all. Can We Still Govern? is a reader-supported publication. Consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. The intent seemed to be to create an iconic image reminiscent of the White House Situation Room during the raid that killed Osama bin Laden-a gathering of stoic men (no girls allowed!) staring grimly at some unseen screen. The message: \"Look how serious and important our work is!\" Yet, the staged nature of these photos undermines that effect, leaving the whole scene feeling less like history in the making and more like an amateur theater production of a Broadway classic. In one image, the Director of the CIA, the Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Secretary of Defense are grouped around a laptop. Behind them, unmistakably, a screen displays a feed from X-complete with a prominent yellow emoji. In other pictures, \"Venezuela\" appears to be in the search box.

Under new work requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly called Food Stamps), the main US program that helps low-income families afford food, a slow month with this erratic scheduling could strip him and his family of vital assistance. That's despite this dad averaging 32 hours of work per week-well above the 80-hour monthly minimum the law will soon require.

But the dad working at the pizzeria is not lazy or unwilling to work. In fact, he is doing everything he can to work more hours, taking on extra last-minute shifts when offered. But sometimes his shifts are cancelled or he is sent home early when business is slow. He is one of the parents in a study we have been conducting with over 1,000 service-worker parents, as part of our decade-long research collaboration on the realities of low-wage work and parenting in the 21 st -century United States. His story reveals that today's low-wage work environment is defined by extreme volatility that workers cannot control. The low-wage labor market has fundamentally changed. With the decline of middle-skill jobs and the economic shift away from manufacturing, workers with low levels of formal education- especially parents-are now concentrated in the service sector. Service sector jobs are volatile, with work schedules, like this dad's, fluctuating in response to factors such as foot traffic, weather, local sporting events, and corporate profit targets.

The Dog that Didn't Bark: Trump Before we get into what Mamdani did talk about, its also worth noting what he didn't talk about. A striking aspect of the speech was the relative inattention to Trump.

The goal was to convert what was seen as a liberal institution into a conservative one using government money and purges.

Members of a National Academy of Sciences committee share insights From Don: The last half-decade has been an extraordinary time for poverty in America. The pandemic triggered a series of policy experiments. One of them, the expansion of the Child Tax Credit (CTC), drew directly from a 2019 National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report on child poverty. The result of this experiment was extraordinarily successful but short-lived. This end of the that experiment saw poverty rebound. The NAS recently issued a follow-up report that again addresses the question of what America can do to ensure that children in America don't live in poverty. The committee that issued the report is made up of some of the most distinguished researchers on poverty in America. I asked some of them to share what they have learned, which you can read below. An important disclaimer is that they are writing this piece as independent scholars, not on behalf of the committee or the NAS. Subscribe now The U.S has one of the highest child poverty rates of any developed nation. Within the U.S., children are the age group most likely to be living in poverty, with rates about 50% higher than both working-aged adults and the elderly. In 2019, the NAS released an expert committee report (\"Roadmap to Reducing Child Poverty\") on possible federal policies that could reduce child poverty by 50% within the next ten years. One of the committee's key findings was that by expanding the CTC, a tax credit for families with children, into a universal child allowance of $3,000 per-child child poverty would be reduced by about 40%. A number of controversies emerged following the release of the report. Some questioned whether turning the CTC into a universal child allowance was the right tool for reducing child poverty. Indeed, the credit was never intended to serve as an anti-poverty program. It was established in 1997 as a $400 per-child credit to offset tax liability for middle-income families but it was subsequently expanded to provide benefits to low-income families as well. Others ",

Those on the right are, whether they admit it or not, aligning themselves with an increasingly authoritarian model of governance under Trump. Even before Trump's second term began, many progressive thinkers were forming their own criticisms of public institutions as too tied down by procedural constraints to actually realize their goals. I don't know which vision will win, or what the future of American governance will look like, but the safest bet is that it will look significantly different from the past. This December, I will match any new paid subscriptions to Can We Still Govern? with an equivalent gift to Give Directly , so consider subscribing! The combination of Trumpist authoritarianism and the many flavors of abundance sit uncomfortably together. A reasonable claim is that in the spaces where progressives still hold institutional power, they need to use it better, as well as plan for how to use federal power when they regain it. An unreasonable claim is that Trump is teaching Democrats how to govern. An example of this claim came from a recent essay by Marc Dunkelman in the New York Times, What the Left Could Learn From Trump's Brutal Efficiency . Dunkelman has worked in Democratic administrations and wrote the widely praised Why Nothing Works: Who Killed Progress and How to Bring it Back. The essay therefore does not come from a Trump defender, but reveals what I think is a temptation, even among his opponents, to treat Trumpism as a model for the future. This mistakes action for achievement, dismantling for building, and corruption for progress. To be fair to Dunkelman, I am going to quote him directly and extensively. I do so not to dunk on Dunkeman, but because I think it is an argument that deserves a response.

    "text": "January Supporters Update: A Book, A Podcast, An Anniversary Request Hitting 2026 at a mad dash, it seems. Hello! This is Everything Is Amazing , a newsletter about science, awe, wonder and tackling the future like the right kind of idiot . Staying with last edition's consideration of the terrible but oddly comforting vastness of geological time , behold this brain-melter of a thing: It's a composite of images from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile , which is spending the next 10 years scanning the night sky to reveal it in the most incredible detail. Take the very first image, which the following pictures dizzyingly zoom out from. First, you can see stars in what I'm laughingly going to refer to as the \"foreground\" (they're still quadrillions of miles away). These are some of the brightest objects within the Milky Way galaxy we're part of, with the furthest being around 27,000 light years distant. Behind them is the 50-60 million light year distance to the Virgo Cluster of around 1,300 galaxies, some of which you can see as much larger spirals, with three of them merging together like creamer in a coffee cup in the upper right&#8230; And behind all those, in ginormously deeper space, you can see galaxies so far away that some may not even exist anymore because of the colossal amount of time that their light - this light, the light we're seeing in these images here - has taken to reach us. Yet - all that is just a tiny, tiny part of our night sky. You could cover it with your thumb at arm's length. As part of the total, it's basically nothing. Ye gawds. There's just so much out there. If your mind can take it, you can find more images like that at Scientific American 's Best Space Photos of 2025 . At the end of this month, it'll be five years since I started Everything Is Amazing , so it feels like a good time to shake things up a bit. In a few days, our next season begins - here's what we're mainly looking at, and also this . But I also wanted to share a few updates on the bigger projects I'm working on behind the scenes - starting with a book idea I first had whil",

It's just that *you've* gone past.\" - Terry Pratchett Subscribe now I'm sending this newsletter out just after 10pm. According to Carl Sagan's famous cosmic calendar (first outlined in his 1977 book The Dragons Of Eden ): if you think of the entire history of the universe represented by the year that's almost passed, it's only at 10.30pm on New Year's Eve that human beings first arrive on the scene. That's in fifteen minutes, so we don't even exist yet. What a very odd thought. (It's even odder if you define \"human\" as \"a member of the subspecies Homo Sapiens Sapiens \" because then we only pop up at 11.58pm - barely enough time to fling off our coats and grab a glass of warm Prosecco.) I have no idea how all this makes you feel. Giddy? Horrified? Riddled with existential vertigo? Perhaps you're in awe of just how long we've been around! This haunts me. Everything but the most recent sliver of human history (just a half-dozen millennia out of hundreds) is an ongoing mystery. All those people , more or less just like us , living their lives! Blimey. Who were they, beyond the fragmentary traces they've left for us? What were they thinking ? It's impossible to say (but enormous fun to speculate about - just ask any archaeologist). Perhaps you need a drink now. Well, I guess this is a good night for it? What I mostly feel is three things: Mortification , because when I excitedly posted this on my social media accounts earlier today, I incorrectly wrote \"think of the entire history of the Earth represented by the year that's almost passed\" - and I didn't spot this error for at least 20 minutes. Egg meets face. I mean, I have actual scientists following me on there. This is not the way I wanted to start 2026. A second bout of awe , when I realised the Earth only makes its appearance around 70% of the way through that list, seven-tenths of this epic Story So Far already being over - and even if I adjusted this Cosmic Calendar into a version solely featuring the Earth, we'd still only be making our first appearance after 11.30p",

This was pre-internet times, at least in the part of Yorkshire I grew up in, and since I had recently decided to try becoming a professional writer, my options seemed limited. My best bet? Submitting something to the BBC Radio 4 Afternoon Play - a daily slot with an absolutely ravenous appetite for new fiction, offering hundreds or sometimes even thousands (!!!) of pounds for a really good story - and when they accepted my manuscript and I was officially Discovered by all the big talent agencies, I could sit back and watch the money roll in. Did I actually have a really good story? Not in the least. That would have required effort, which I tended to avoid, and writing skill, which I wasn't yet aware I lacked. But hey, I had the next-best thing: I had a great character . Story is just character in action, right? Well then. Job mostly done! And wasn't my character completely brilliant ? Admittedly, it was heavily inspired by a few others. (\"Stolen\" might be a more legally-precise word.) I'd recently read W.E. Bowman's magnificent mountaineering satire The Ascent Of Rum Doodle , and become greatly enamoured of its hapless protagonist, Binder - and then I discovered Terry Pratchett's Corporal Carrot in all his heroic simplicity (which is not saying he's stupid, as I previously explained here ). My character - let's call him M. - was incapable of thinking the worst of strangers. This illustration of Hanlon's Razor would be utterly wasted on him, because it would never even occur to him that other people might act out of meanness, cruelty and petty spite. I mean, why would they? That would be awful ! In his blissful innocence, M. would enthusiastically blunder through the world, approaching each challenge with near-perfect innocence and getting taken to the absolute cleaners by every feckless scoundrel he met along the way.

This is Everything Is Amazing , a newsletter about science, curiosity, mind-blown wonder , and the timeless power of using stock photos of cats to lazily manipulate people's emotions. Subscribe now This particular newsletter - a continuation of this series - is going to be unusually ridiculous (and not just because I'm narrating it: see audio, above). Not at all what I originally intended. I mean - you know how it usually works by now, right? Some well-meaning plonker - that would be me - sets himself the task of investigating the latest science into a thing in the hope of discovering something quietly astonishingly, the kind of thing that has you mumbling \"wow!\" when you read it in a news headline on the way to work. All delivered with a level of amiable knowing amateurism, but backed up with links to people in science doing the actual work here. That's been my hope, in looking into the reasons why I can't get a good night's sleep these days, and what I can do about it. I'd stumble over some weird new thing that actually seems to work according to a number of credibly sceptical studies, and then I try it upon myself, and it works, and I get to write about it in my own excitable way. This time I'd even hoped for a bit more, actually. Maybe I could even invent something - you know, that thing I never get to do, because I'm not a scientist and don't have my own lab or team, and, well, I don't know anything. But what if I could do it this time? Not something unsafe of course, just something tap-dancing on that fine line between clever and stupid. Say: take a 300 microgram pill of melatonin, shove it inside a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup (those things always make me sleepy), add a sprinkle of creatine and a couple of drops of Head & Shoulders anti-dandruff shampoo, and then knock the whole thing back with a mug of malted Horlicks.

Only time will tell if this ruins me or not.) Subscribe now Before we start - a quick update on a previous story. Earlier this year I wrote about the &#8216;blobs of nightmarishly gargantuan proportions' thousands of kilometres under the surface of Earth that seem to be feeding the tree-like mantle plumes responsible for some of the world's volcanic hot-spots. It's been proposed, somewhat speculatively so far, that they're remnants of Theia , a Mars-sized protoplanet slamming into the Earth some 4.5 billion years ago on our planet's undisputed Worst Day Ever, and ejecting enough debris into orbit that it glommed together into what we know as the Moon. This week, a fascinating update: a new study from the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research looking for the fingerprints of Theia in iron isotopes from lunar & Earth samples and meteorites has concluded it must have formed in the inner Solar System - but maybe just a bit closer to the Sun than us. (Just how much of a neighbour it was is currently unknown, and maybe even impossible to determine.). Regarding the mind-boggling drama of a proposed Earth-Theia impact, imagine a lava lamp the size of a planet: Thank heavens that 4.5 billion years is a surprisingly long time (as I tried to explain here ). On a very different scale, I was tickled by this tragic reminder that it's not easy being a writer these days: Still, on we go! In a few days, an update on my quest for a good night's sleep .

    "text": "Wet Legs At 5AM One of my worst ideas. (And that's really saying something.) Note: this piece is accompanied by a voiceover, read by the author. Click above to listen. In the late 1990s, I decided my current method of pursuing a happy and successful life, which involved not putting much effort into anything except playing videogames and patiently waiting to win the National Lottery, wasn't serving me terribly well - so I decided to go back to school. What I really wanted was a place at university - but since I was in my late twenties at this point and my grades were profoundly limiting (top marks for English Language & Literature, a \"C\" for Geology and the rest a fruitless shambles), my best bet was retaking the exams I'd mostly fluffed in 1988, to make my way to the A-levels that would hopefully give me a shot at either York or Sheffield's Archaeology undergraduate programme. To do this: school. Not my former high school in my Yorkshire seaside home-town, which didn't accept mature students - but a college in the nearby city of Hull. This meant two things: I, a vain and listless bespectacled young man of 27 years old, had to sit in classrooms with 16 and 17 year old, with both of us trying to pretend this felt even vaguely normal. The fact I acquired the nickname \"Uncle Mike\" should tell you something. But really, I think it was a lot weirder for them that it was for me - and I'm not saying there's a firm connection here, but one of my fellow classmates later pretended he was King Arthur on American television, and that's just one example that I know about. God knows how the rest of them are faring. It meant I had to catch an incredibly early bus from the rural seaside town I live in. This meant getting up at 5 o'clock, which I was amazed to discover is a time not just in the afternoon, but also in the morning . I found this very confusing: why bother? Everyone is asleep. What's the point in giving it a name? In the end, I'd catch that bus at WTF-o'clock four times a week for nearly 3 years - and this is how I discovered my sleeping superpo",

This is Everything Is Amazing , a newsletter about science, applied curiosity, and why all our maps could be the wrong way round . As I announced recently, I'll soon be starting a new series on getting a better night's sleep that will be behind the paywall - so as a run-up to that, here's a story I originally published last year. It lays out exactly why sleep is so thunderously important to our health, and how quickly and how completely we fall apart without it. Forward we go to sleeplessness and horror - accompanied by a gruff, British voiceover from the idiot who writes this newsletter. When I first started writing for a living, my head was filled with a lot of damn-fool notions about writing - the kind you'd never hear from a highly accomplished veteran, but you would hear from someone on social media whose only body of work was a loud, desperate-sounding need to appear authoritative. Since I was learning to be Extremely Online a lot quicker than I was learning to write, I internalised a lot of those confidently wrong ways to become A Proper Writer. One of these was around intentional sleep deprivation, to stimulate the imagination. It's true that as you push far beyond your normal sleep cycle, you reach a point where you're hallucinating on your feet. Woah! Wouldn't that be a good source of really imaginative and out-the-box thinking? suggested the person whose tweet I can't now find, probably because they're now either deceased or working in investment banking.

    "text": "Hey, What Are All These Books Doing To Us? And is everything about to change? Hello again! Today's the last day of the end-of-season offer for Everything Is Amazing - and it's time to explain what's coming for paid subscribers in the upcoming season. If I may, I'd like to introduce you to a book that's very special to me. Every year at this time (it's my birthday today), I like to sit by a window and read it for a while, to remind myself how ludicrously subjective the term \"old\" is. The spine crackles as you open it, and the pages have a musty scent that's so complicated it could only be the product of decades of moving through the world, soaking up the smells of so many different rooms and their furnishings and occupants, until it's become a piece of 20th-Century olfactory archaeology. (Yes, that term refers to a real branch of research ! No, I didn't know this either.) And its author? It's the work of an entrepreneurial young journalist writer from London, whose stuff you really should read. Sketches By Boz is a series of 56 portraits of Londoners and their environment, a mixture of the true and fictional, accompanied by beautiful illustrations, and eventually bundled together into&#8230;well, this: Boz didn't have any problems marketing this book: pretty much all the major London newspapers and magazines eagerly agreed to run many of these \"sketches\" in their pages because they were already wildly popular. (Think of it as a British semi-fictionalised version of Humans Of New York , with a similar level of fame for its time). However, that wasn't Boz's master-stroke. Seeing the massive potential for serialized content like this, he'd been working on another title - a wholly fictional story he was eagerly writing his way into. But instead of choosing to publish that as a book, he drew on his journalism experience to release each new segment of the story as a separately printed pamphlet, a &#8216;column' printed outside of a newspaper, and sold for the equivalent of the price of a beverage.

    "text": "Season 7 Is Done! What's Next? [Part Two] We're going in search of trees and books and an *incredible* night's sleep. Hello again. Hot on the heels of yesterday's look at where Season 7 of Everything Is Amazing took us - here's where we're going in the next season, and during the six weeks leading up to it. When I was a kid, I fell hopelessly in love with a children's adventure novel my late father gave to me: Brothers Robin, John and Harold are waiting for their parents to return from India and suffering under the stern guardianship of their Aunt Ellen - and during the Easter holidays from their boarding school, Harold catches measles. Having missed the window for returning to school for the next term and facing the profound existential horror of spending months ( months! ) with Aunt Ellen, the three boys pack their bags, steal some food and their father's rifle and some ammunition, and decide to go live in the woods as outlaws. (At this point Robin, of course, renames himself \"Robin Hood\", John as \"Big John\" and Harold as \"Little John\".) Hijinks naturally ensue. They build a shelter within a hollow oak tree, they eat whatever they can forage, kill & cook, and start wearing rabbit-skin coats after their clothes wear out. (I can't remember how many rabbits this involved, but of course there's somewhere on the Internet that calculates stuff like this, and it must be hundreds. ) After 8 months of evading capture by the fun-ruining adults of the local police force, the intrepid trio heroically turn themselves in to save the life of a loner they've befriended in the woods - just in time to meet their father, to explain themselves in a way that makes him proud, and presumably to celebrate with lashings of ginger beer. It's that kind of story. The story ends with an escaped bear they encountered earlier in the story, finding their hollow oak tree and settling into it to hibernate away the coming winter. Brendon Chase was published in 1944, but is set in earlier, seemingly simpler times, with all the wistfulness you might expect from a book written during one of the most violent social co",

In the last month, many who want to kill Polymarket have agreed on a common strategy: claim that Polymarket allows illegal \"insider trading\". I've received roughly a dozen media inquiries about this in the last few weeks. E.g., some articles: 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 . This is the strategy: In 2011, the US CFTC issued Rule 180.1 prohibiting any commodity market trades accompanied by \"deceptive\" talk. Since then the CFTC has interpreted this rule as prohibiting trades based on info obtained via a breach of a duty of trust or confidentiality. Some recent profitable Polymarket trades have been accused (without evidence) of being based on such \"inside info\". But Polymarket is a crypto system, where they cannot usually know who are their traders. QED: Polymarket must be shut down. I see much misleading talk in my world, so a rule against deceptive talk relevant to trades seems to me to not actually be enforced much. And also quite hard to fairly enforce, and in any case not clearly needed. The US Supreme Court has struck down laws against lying on free speech grounds, unless such lies produce \"material gain\". I'm not convinced we should distinguish material vs non-material gains re lies. In any case, trading on info that you promised to keep secret does not remotely \"deceive\" markets re your or their trades. Furthermore, I don't think it makes sense to generally assign to all our social institutions the task of preventing anyone from revealing secrets that they instead promised to keep. If you come to my store to buy a dress for your wife, and reveal to me her dress size, I don't think it should be my job to check that it was okay with your wife for you to tell me her dress size. The two of you should be in charge of figuring out how to enforce your info promises to each other. As a closer analogy, both journalism and speculative markets are info institutions, which reach out to collect info from the world, aggregate that info into useful summaries, and then spread those summar",

    "text": "Christian Cultural Drift Re civ decline, my basic story is that a key contribution to the fall of civilizations is plausibly that as a civ gets big, rich, and peaceful, its local cultural evolution process parameters get worse, at least at the culture level. Re civ decline, my basic story is that a key contribution to the fall of civilizations is plausibly that as a civ gets big, rich, and peaceful, its local cultural evolution process parameters get worse, at least at the culture level. There is typically lower variety, weaker selection pressures, and faster environmental change. So the process goes bad, its cultures drift into maladaption, and the civ falls. Our current civ will plausibly suffer this fate, with the added problem that due to modern cultural activism we also have higher rates of internal cultural drift. What does this say about Christianity? Early on it was a small sect competing with many others, and the fact that it won against them suggests that it was unusually adaptive then, at least in that context. Then it took over the Roman Empire and most of Europe, and became securely in pace for millennia. And while securely in place, Christianity substantially changed its character many times. So doesn't my theory suggest that those changes would on average have been maladaptive? Well first notice that most Europeans didn't know much about Christian doctrine re how to live ordinary peasant lives until about 1600 or so. Before then Christianity mainly influenced elites, cities, and larger institutions. Also, there was often lots of competition within Christianity; the cultural evolution problem would only be re cultural features that were imposed on everyone in Christianity, allowing little local deviation. Okay, but Christianity influenced marriage much earlier, from about 1200, promoting monogamy and banning cousins marriage, and that suppressed family clans. Christianity also pushed individualism early on, via consent in marriage and the freedom to write wills, especially donations to the Church. And those wills funded many big monasteries, which slowly took over lots of European land. Also, conflicts between the church and crowns started early and weakly contributed to the lack of a single power taking o",

One of the greatest obstacles to humanity using abstract thought to help on its biggest issues is this: our main professional specialists in abstract though applied to big issues are academics, and they refuse to think abstractly about how they allocate resources. Academics are divided into an inherited structure of disciplines and subfields, a structure that changes only slowly. The focuses within each subfield fluctuate with changing fashions, the relative size of fields changes as outside funding changes, and sometimes funding allows the creation of new fields. The ( high -dimensional) space of all possible abstract topics, however, is only sparsely populated by this structure. Most of that population is in dense \"urban\" clusters, with few residents of the vast \"rural\" tracks outside of those clusters. Most of sources of resources and prestige for academics are tied to those clusters, which discourages them from venturing outside of those clusters. Academics are so tied to their little \"cities\" that they have only vague concepts of most of the space outside of it. In fact, only ~2% of academics could give a coherent intelligible (but not necessarily correct) answer to this question: \"Why is your particular research nearly the most cost-effective among the options available?\" (This has long been my personal experience.) Few academics can justify their research relative to anything besides other nearby research. The sort that might cite them, and which they might cite. The question of why that whole area is funded is of little interest to them. A big factor that causes academics to clump strongly in topic space is that they strongly prefer to use the most prestigious methods available in each area. As research is mainly judged for its prestige-potential, not its social value. This heavily favors the topics that better allow one to show of one's mastery of prestigious methods. Other topics are neglected. The intrinsic value of topics in this vast space of possible t",

In one poll I divided the civ's history into 4 parts: start to rise, finish rise, start to fall, finish fall. In another , I divided it into 5 parts: flat turns to rise, mid rise, peak where rise turns to fall, mid fall, fall turns to flat. For the 5 part split, 61% most blamed peak , with equal 19% going to each of the two adjacent periods. For the 4 part split, 52% say start fall , and 35% finish rise . Thus the most blame is given to those around just after the fall begins. And as most of my readers are below age 50, and about half of age 50 readers should be alive in 35 years, that's you.

In a poll of America's favorite architecture, 76% of buildings selected were traditional/classical. A study of courthouse architecture determined that &#8230; &#8216;most non-architects dislike &#8216;modern' design and have done so for almost a century.' Yet 92% of new federal government buildings are modern. ( More ) Which raises the question of why such styles are so often chosen. The obvious proximate answer is that elites choose them to impress other elites, who tend to prefer specialist not popular evaluations, even when they represent democratic governments. But why do they do this? Scott Alexander, author of the above quote, suggests as explanations: elites trying to hide not flaunt wealth, getting out of touch with popular tastes, becoming more Protestant, seeing timeless aesthetic truths, responding to rising labor costs, splitting off from popular tastes, or signaling taste instead of wealth. Samuel Hughes says: Modernism was driven by artists & the intellectual circles that surrounded them. In the case of some arts, &#8230; music &#8230; literature, it never really left those circles: &#8230; In &#8230; other art forms, rich people were eventually drawn in to some degree. ( more ) Which seems right, but raises the question of why artists diverged and how they were able to get away with it. When search for explanations of social trends, it seems better if possible to focus on trends which one well understands in fundamental terms, so one needn't ask what caused those trends. And one such key trend for understand the modern world is: the rise of professions. Medieval guilds declined greatly in power after ~1600.

Animal brains compute DNA-encoded behavioral strategies, using DNA chosen by simple natural selection. Such brains can \"reason\", but not very abstractly, and mostly about how to execute their DNA-given instincts. Animals don't reason about where such strategies came from. In humans, DNA encodes sufficiently-sophisticated brains to let us copy others' behaviors. As a result, in humans a cultural form of natural selection allows us to evolve behaviors far faster than do other animals. This is humanity's superpower. It induces us to reason more, about how best to generalize from the behaviors we see, and also about which humans to copy which behaviors from. The invention of language let humans more easily transfer many things between our brains, to do so more abstractly, and to reason more easily about it all. We humans thus became more ambitious about the scope and abstraction of our reasoning. We humans eventually came to realize that we could try to reason critically about the behaviors which we have inherited via cultural evolution. But as natural selection didn't document its code, we mostly made up plausible-sounding reasons for such behaviors. While some of us were sometimes willing to change behavior based on such reasoning, this typically went badly, as we didn't understand why evolution had made its choices. Thankfully, most others didn't much respect or heed such reasoning. During the Industrial Revolution, humanity saw many big fast changes to tech and social practices, and initially tried to preserve prior cultural values, norms, and status markers in the face of such changes. But then around roughly 1900, elites suddenly began a big new \" modernism \" project to try to remake culture via abstract reason. Abstract reason was then high status, it had been credited for much of those tech and business changes, and was the central focus of the new schools that most everyone now attended into until adulthood, and which decided much about their status in life.

I have long posted on studies that try to make sense of how human values differ, and how they have changed over time. A new paper in Social Science Quarterly tries to compare four different proposed values models, by modeling the network of correlations of the variables they see as central. This diagram shows their key result: three clumps of 2-4 named clusters, each of which has 3-10 correlated variables: Alas that paper doesn't give names for the particular variables, and some of the clump names seem overly opaque. But what I can see is still interesting. The bottom of the diagram seem to be items most closely related to status. The lower right clump (called \"virtuous agency\") matters most to modern elites, while the middle clump (called \"power and social order\") mattered more in the farming era. Did the upper right clump (called \"hierarchical individualism\") matter most to foragers, and also matter more now due to a toward-forager modern culture trend? I've suggested that many modern differences are due to moderns seeing themselves as higher status, due to their higher wealth. If so, that virtuous agency would also have mattered more to farming era elites, while the power and social order clump should matter more to non-elites today.",

    "text": "Left And Right As Abstract Non-Conformist Hypocrisy A small but real part of the variation in the policy positions taken by individuals and organizations is explained by two key factors: an econ and a (social/identity/) culture factor. A small but real part of the variation in the policy positions taken by individuals and organizations is explained by two key factors: an econ and a (social/identity/) culture factor. Two diagrams show distributions of stated positions re these factors: Some \"stylized facts\" to consider: Each side (i.e., left or right) varies less on one factor more \"central\" to it than on the other: the left less on econ, the right less on culture. So there are far more (upper left of diagrams) \"authoritarian\" left econ and right culture folks than there are (lower right of diagrams) \"libertarian\" right econ and left culture folks. The median left, median right, and libertarian positions roughly form a triangle. The more educated vary less on the less central factor. So the very educated are more polarized, and are more a 1D distribution, while others are more 2D. Policy typically sits more in the middle of this space, compared to median opinion. So policy is more libertarian, and also closer to the median educated. Over centuries, policy has moved toward the left on both axes, though it has moved more in culture than econ over the last half century, and moved more on econ than culture in the prior half century. Compared to high level govt policy, govt policy details, and also individual behavior, sit even more toward the middle of this space. The right divorces more and gives more to charity, while the left conserves less energy and more blocks low income housing. I'm tempted to explain these patterns this way: In terms of the many details of policy, our implied positions on these axes, averaging over these details, are roughly distributed as independent Normals. But to take a visible abstract position in that middle feels too conformist. Most want instead to look abstractly principled and different. So most prefer to visibly identify with one of the two popular principled and different abstract positions: left econ or right culture. (Fewer take the also principled and different a",

    "text": "What Is Liberal Futarchy? What measurable outcomes should a futarchy government try to maximize? What measurable outcomes should a futarchy government try to maximize? One answer is \"let democracy decide\"; a democratic futarchy has its citizens directly vote to choose outcome metrics, or elect representatives who so choose. As democracy is our status quo today, I've usually described futarchy in these terms. But another answer is \"they should be liberal\". Liberalism ideally allows different individuals and groups to peaceably pursue different ends under a common government. So what ex-post measurable futarchy outcome metrics could promote a liberal order? It turns out that \"liberal\" has meant many different things over the centuries. Some say \"liberal\" means \"make the worse off person better off\". But are we allowed to kill people, or prevent them from existing, to achieve this? And the fact that there are so many different ways to measure \"worse off\" seems to make this approach pretty fragile. Others say \"liberal\" means \"rights are preserved\". This suggests minimizing a weighted rate of rights violations, with different kinds of violations getting different weights. But the obvious way to max this is to have zero people doing nothing. And that just can't be what we want. To still others, \"liberal\" has meant \"neutral w.r.t. key features\", features like individual identity, family, region, religion, or ethnicity. Of course we can't be neutral w.r.t. all features, but we could add a constraint that futarchy outcomes can't refer directly to certain key features. However, what about other features that strongly correlate with key features? Even if we managed to ban outcome metrics referring to any features that too strongly correlate with key features, that is still just a constraint on outcome metrics; it doesn't tell us what metrics to use. Another concept of \"liberal\" is \"easy exit\". And exit is easier when you can take more value with you as you leave, part of which comes from selling what you have before you leave. So a liberal outcome metric might come from a",

I don't think so. Yes, it's a frequent subject of conversation; we're all quite aware of random hit-and-runs and lottery tickets and unwelcome masses found, too late, in loved one's bodies. But we treat luck as the exception rather than the rule, as though it occasionally pokes its head into our lives, quite consequentially, for better or worse - Surprise! - but is usually a bit player. Take Cuba. I went there in 2022 with a couple of friends. Coincidentally, these friends were probably the only two people in North America who know less Spanish than I do. A lot of Cubans know only limited English, so I did most of the talking. I will be honest: I read a couple of books on Cuba beforehand (I thought Ada Ferrer's was excellent), but I did not do nearly as much research as I should have prior to such an incredible travel opportunity. Work, life, et cetera. So going in, I wasn't sure how forthcoming Cubans would be with a goofy American who spoke toddler-level Spanish. The answer was: very. It was mostly our drivers we had the most in-depth conversations with. After the normal where-ya-from pleasantries - our shared knowledge and touchpoints often centered on Florida - I would try to tactfully and nonchalantly ask, like, \"&#191;Qu&#233; es la situaci&#243;n con la econom&#237;a?\" (not how a competent speaker would ask that question), [TKFN - I'm writing this from a library and as I was typing this sentence I overheard a kid starting a Spanish lesson.] and the drivers would often then go off, at length, about how absolutely screwed everything was. They mostly directed their ire at their own government. U.S. sanctions (which are ridiculous) did come up, but that just wasn't where they put the blame. They told stories about the massive numbers of people who have fled, the ridiculous bureaucracies they'd endured, the corruption, the difficulty of getting basic goods. Cubans have",

However you felt about 2025, I hope 2026 is better. I owe you all some stuff, including the answers to your Ask Me Anything questions. You'll have that soon. Part of the delay stems from the fact that I have a book deadline early next week and I've been crashing a bit. (For anyone who is new to this Substack, the book is about the debate over youth gender medicine in the United States.) I've been meaning to experiment, in a more structured way, with the Substack Live feature. I also need breaks because I can only do so many hours of work in a row. So: Tomorrow at 4:55 PM Eastern, I'll send out a Substack Live link to premium Singal-Minded subscribers and do a 45-minute or so video talk/Q&A about my book. Unless I'm missing something, there's no way to pre-schedule this sort of event without an iPhone, so I'll just send out the link five minutes beforehand. If you're a premium subscriber, you'll get it then and will be just one click from joining the event. I'll start the Hangout with a 10-ish-minute prepared mini-talk/update about the book, and then I'll answer your questions. If you have any questions about my work on youth gender medicine, post them here. I'll favor the most upvoted comments, and I'll also react, in real time, to whatever pops up in the chat. Forty-five minutes is an estimate, and the length will depend a bit on how many questions I get. Subscribe now If you can't make it, no worries - the video will be available for premium subscribers afterward. On a separate note, there are going to be some changes to Singal-Minded this year that I'm excited about, and which I'll be announcing late this month or early in February. But in the meantime, I hope to see a bunch of you tomorrow at 5:00, and I really appreciate your support.

I last overanalyzed \" Mission Viejo \" by Lifter Puller, a band which included two of The Hold Steady's founding members, back in the fall of 2023. The Hold Steady doesn't waste any time getting into \" Cattle and the Creeping Things ,\" the second track on their 2005 album Separation Sunday . It takes just three seconds for frontman Craig Finn's voice to come in: They got to the part with the cattle and the creeping things Said \"I'm pretty sure we heard this one before And don't it all end up in some revelation With four guys on horses and violent red visions? Famine and death and pestilence and war? Pretty sure I heard this one before Think about how much has been established in just 26 seconds. The song's narrator is being preached to, but he is unimpressed. Unimpressed by what? Well, creation, for one thing - \"cattle and the creeping things\" is from Genesis, from God laying out his whole groovy plan : \"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.\" We, the listeners, get a strong feel for this narrator solely through a half-dozen lines of lyrics, helped along by an anxious dun dun dun guitar and piano line. He's a jittery guy. He can barely get through the opening scenes of the Bible before saying, \"Yeah, yeah, I've heard that before - sounds good, but doesn't it all end rather poorly?\" He's more bored and jaded than inspired, let alone enraptured. \"Cattle and the Creeping Things\" was written by Finn and Tad Kubler, his longtime bandmate in both The Hold Steady and Lifter Puller . The Hold Steady's songs are almost all about some combination of parties, partiers, addicts, religion, drugs, and music itself.

Most of the report's arguments about why Harris lost consist of what is now the conventional wisdom: Kamala Harris didn't have a clear message, she didn't present herself as a \"change\" candidate during a \"change\" election, and so on.

These men belong to a sect that believes that it's a mitzvah, a good deed, to get less observant Jews to put on tefillin, which are black leather boxes containing parchment inscribed with verses from the Torah. You wear one on your arm and one on your head - I think the last time I did this was during my bar mitzvah. They'll go up to possibly Jewish men and ask, \"Are you Jewish?\" &#9;Because I have a large, crooked nose, whenever I run in the park, these Jews home in on me like ducks chasing an anthropomorphic sack of bread crumbs. This triggers insecurities I thought I had conquered long ago. I'm otherwise over my nose. It was women I'd always been most concerned about, but over time I realized that some women - perverts - are into noses like mine, and others are willing to overlook it because I have developed so many other positive qualities, though I am precluded by space constraints from listing any of them here. Still, I don't like thinking about my nose, and it's hard to avoid doing so when the Jews of Prospect Park lock on to you like Yiddish-speaking Terminators. &#9;One of these Jews, though - he was different from all the others. He approached me a couple times on my runs this past fall, and I ignored him but I also noticed him. What stood out, at first, was that his body seemed like it should be biomechanically impossible. He was six-foot-eight, easily, a buck fifty soaking wet. I immediately found myself relating to him, simply because of my own feelings about my own dumb body.

This year marks the 5th Anniversary of The Weekly Dish, if you can believe it. It's been an incredible ride - and none of it would have happened without you. Many of you have been there for us since the beginning, and many more have joined these past five years, for which Chris and I thank you from the bottom of our hearts. We're especially grateful given how routinely I piss you all off, on all sides. That says a lot about why Dish subscribers, in our view, are the coolest on the web. I'm also going to save string on my faith memoir until we're done with Trump, and devote my energies to you through 2028. I'll be researching and sketching the book, but not at the expense of the Dish and Dishheads. We started this journey together in May 2016 and I feel an obligation to see it through with you to the end. It's that simple. I hope you'll keep me and Chris company. L: The last day of the Daily Dish in 2015 / R: The dearly departed Bowie Which reminds me. We haven't changed our price for five-and-a-half years, even though inflation has eroded 25 percent of the value in the interim. So to keep up a bit, we're raising the price for new subscribers - to $6 for a monthly plan and $60 for an annual. No current subscriber will be affected - so don't worry. But we're not doing it till the New Year! That gives all of you who keep telling us you mean to get around to subscribing a golden opportunity. Here's your chance to lock in the low current price before it goes up. We really, really hope you do. Subscribe now for $5/month or $50/year If you're a longtime subscriber and have the means to help us keep up with inflation, we'd also be deeply grateful if you choose to increase your sub. It's easy to do. Just click on the \"Upgrade to founding\" button at the very top-right of this page, and pick a price higher than $50 a year. Or, if you're reading this page over email, click here to find the \"Upgrade to founding\" button. (If you don't see the button, go here for quick instruction",

(For the View From Your Window contest, the results below exceed the content limit for Substack's email service, so to ensure that you see the full results, click the headline above .) Some highlights from this week's write-up: The second sunniest city in the United States. One of the world's largest sundials. The largest reservoir in this state. The only bird known to hibernate. A poignant connection to Rob Reiner. From the winner of last week's contest : I can't believe it! Thanks Chris. I'll take the two free years - only because I purchased the book years ago on my own, thinking I would never win. Next stop, super sleuth? You never know. You'll get there. The A2 Team asks: Am I noticing it just now, or is it a new kind of thread in the recent write-ups: taking care of aging parents? Seems to come up ever more frequently. I can relate: I'm currently in Germany to see my 90-year-old mother - still healthy and smart, but with failing short-term memory. Not a place you want to be in. Here in Nuremberg, I get to go into town to buy Christmas stuff for all my children and grandchildren. Here's a photo of the most famous Christmas market in Germany - Nuremberg's Christkindlesmarkt : Too easy for a contest, I'd assume, but as a contribution to the regular reports on bookstores from the Brookline sleuth, let me note that this photo was taken from the bookstore of Korn & Berg, which happens to be Germany's oldest bookstore, founded in 1531. Nuremberg has a couple of these institutions that go back to the days of the Reformation and the print revolution. For instance, the school I attended here for a few years has been around since 1526. Eagle Rock serves up \"a note about last week's contest \": \"Rum, Sodomy, and the Lash\" also happens to be the title of a favorite album by the Pogues. It was produced by Elvis Costello, who said, \"I saw my task was to capture them in their dilapidated glory before some more professional producer fucked them up.\" The cover art is pretty choi",

Some highlights from this week's write-up: A sleuth who got engaged in this view, and another who honeymooned there. A band named Bumpin' Uglies. A super-sleuth with a moving tribute to his dad, who died in hospice not terribly far from this window last week. A crabby profile. A reverse red herring? From the winner of last week's contest : Cool! I'll take the book. Thanks, Chris! I'm chuffed to receive the following note from a \"long-time reader and off-and-on subscriber here\": The last time I paused my subscription, I wondered what would make me reactivate it. Yesterday morning, when I opened the VFYW write-up and saw photo #487, I found out! I glanced at it and thought, \"Huh, that looks an awful lot like downtown!\" Zooming in confirmed that the photo really was taken three blocks away from my house, here in my adopted hometown of Hamilton! Of all the college towns I've lived in, it's the smallest - and the one I'd have guessed to be the least likely to show up in VFYW! So congratulations, Chris, you got me to resubscribe ! I always enjoy the follow-up notes, so I'm sharing a few of my own here. A few things my fellow sleuths didn't cover include: Two doors down from the Zen Den is Flour and Salt Bakery , where they make the best pain au chocolat that I've had outside of Paris. Hamilton is delightfully walkable, so I'm including a few views from my walks, including the exterior of Oliveri's from the corner of Lebanon and Maple (the well-lit place on the left side of the street): &#8230; the tree in the Village Green lit for the holidays (which will be joined by a menorah next week): &#8230; and a bridge over Payne Creek, which leads into Taylor Lake: As you can see from the photos, winter is well underway here.

People I know are buzzing about Brick, the physical device that locks you out of certain apps on your phone; the concept of going \"analog\" has become so trendy other people are getting annoyed with it. There's the New York Times 's 2026 predictions , which include \"dumb phones as status symbols,\" a \"war on slop,\" and \"the rise of exfluencers.\" The Washington Post claims \"phone-free bars\" are in. Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, says sharing personal moments to the feed \" is dead .\" Students in New York City and New Jersey are seeing benefits from bans on phones in schools. I don't think we've hit this tipping point because we suddenly wanted it enough, or that this will be the year we all come together and get more disciplined. Instead, I think we just left a year when social media got fundamentally less interesting. The only reason cutting down on screen time was ever hard was because we wanted to look at our phones. But over the past few months, as I methodically opened and closed my stable of apps, I slowly realized just how long it's been since I found what I was looking for. I would say one out of every ten Instagram accounts that follow me these days is a real person. The rest a",

With quite literally the entire world at our fingertips, all any of us wanted to see was the place that we were already sitting in.

    "text": "How The MrBeast Undisclosed Ad Thing Works Read to the end for a real good anime opening Welcome to Garbage Weekend. It's the internet garbage you know and love, but in a format that's easier to read while you consume undisclosed ads on X, the everything app. ( X.com/SHL0MS ) PLATFORMS MrBeast's X video (not a porn thing) is being promoted as an undisclosed ad, except not exactly. It's showing up in people's videos without a label, which has led many to believe X was breaking the law. But I spoke to an X employee about this and think I understand what's happening here. There is a pre-roll ad from Shopify in front of MrBeast's video. X's pre-roll feature is called Amplify , and when a post contains a video that has an Amplify ad in it, the post is boosted like an ad, but without the label. Because technically, MrBeast's post is not the ad and thus doesn't require one. The ad is the Shopify pre-roll, which is correctly labeled as an ad for users who press play. This would also explain all the other not-an-ad boosted posts you're seeing. The ad is loaded in front of the video inside of the post. Get it? Bluesky dropped their moderation report. My interest in Bluesky ebbs and flows, but I really appreciate how pragmatic they're being about moderation. Their central philosophy seems to be that giving users more mod tools alleviates some of the pressure on a social network's trust and safety team. I'm watching this closely because it's possible that that's true. It's also equally possible that this approach is the digital equivalent sweeping bad content under the couch. Those \" ghost trends \" on X aren't new, but we can see them now. The user WilburTheBulldog dropped this in the Discord and it's a really fascinating look at how bad X is falling apart. I first saw these on a work trip to Mumbai back in 2015. They're very common in India, where groups called \"IT cells\" are constantly manipulating trending topics to the point where they no longer work. And without moderation we're now seeing the same thing in every country. Reddit is eyeing an IPO. Well, that ex",

    "text": "A new way to measure X’s current level of decay Read to the end for a \"live Skibidi Toilet performance\" MrBeast Uploaded A Full Video To X (X.com/elonmusk) On Monday, MrBeast uploaded a video to X titled, \"$1 vs $100,000,000 Car,\" which is, of course, exactly what it sounds like. The upload comes weeks after Musk started pathetically begging MrBeast to post his videos to X. Also, last week, declared that X was a \"video-first platform\". So he's now spinning MrBeast's first full-length upload as a big win to celebrate. MrBeast had previously said he wasn't going to post anything to X because his videos are too expensive to waste them there. (My words, not his lol.) Neither Musk or MrBeast, however, have acknowledged that this wasn't an exclusive video for X, nor is it even a new video. It premiered on his YouTube channel back in September. But the fact MrBeast has finally soft-embraced X, the everything app that is also now a video-first app, is useful for measuring X's current level of decay. As of this morning, the original upload of \"$1 vs $100,000,000 Car,\" on YouTube has 212 million views. After about two days on X, it has 78 million. Which seems pretty good until you realize those are views for the X post the video is embedded in. It seems like not an accident that we can no longer see views on X videos anymore. The post has 29,000 shares, which means it's getting about an average of 2,600 passive views every time someone shares it. Though, I'm sure a bulk of those views come from Musk's followers. And, unlike when you watch it on YouTube, there weren't any ads that played ahead of it when I watched it. There is a sponsored segment towards the end of the video, which may be why they used this one. And there were a few (disclosed) ads in the replies beneath it. \"I'm super curious how much the ad revenue will make,\" MrBeast posted. Musk didn't respond to that, but separately replied, \"It's a great time to be a content creator on &#120143;.\" My guess is it will not make nearly as much as it made on YouTube.

There are probably real ways to do it ethically and I think some generative-AI tools could easily fit into existing applications like Photoshop or After Effects. If you hate it and think it's evil, though, that's fine, I get it.

And the only reason to do that is to advertise something or scam people.

The way it would work is that certain videos will only play a snippet unless you're a paying subscriber. This is actually so idiotic that I'm having trouble fully articulating why.

I'm still unclear what to make of #WaterTok, but I eventually settled on the idea that it's several subcultures overlapping - weight-loss communities, Mormons, and those people who don't like the \"taste\" of water. But in the majority of the #WaterTok videos I watched, people were using Stanley's Quencher to carry around their liquid Jolly Ranchers. And the ubiquity of the cup has sort of haunted me ever since. I grew up in the suburbs, but I don't live there anymore. So every time the great silent majority of American basicness summons a new totem to gather around, I can't help but try and make sense of it. Was this a car thing? A college football tailgate thing? An EDM thing? Cruise ships? Barstool Sports was of no help here, so I filed it away until this Christmas when it exploded across the web and forced me to finally figure out what the heck was going on. And it turns out, the Stanley cup's transformation into a must-have last year is actually, in many ways, the story of everything now. CNBC put together a great explainer on this. Stanley, a manly hundred-year-old brand primarily aimed at hikers and blue-collar workers, was rediscovered in 2019 by the bloggers behind a women's lifestyle and shopping site called The Buy Guide. They told CNBC that even though the Quencher model of the cup was hard to find, no other cup on the market had what they were looking for. Which is a bizarrely passionate stance to take on a water bottle, but from their post about the cup, those attributes were: \"Large enough to keep up with our busy days, a handle to carry it wherever we go, dishwasher safe, fits into our car cupholders, keeps ice cold for 12+ hours, and a straw.\" The Buy Guide team then sent a Quencher to Emily Maynard Johnson from The Bachelor after she had a baby because \"there is no thirst like nursing mom thirst!\" Johns",

Though, that brings me to my other point here, which is that all the junk on X is both filling a vacuum left by clear, non-paywalled explanations of what was actually revealed and also egged on by numerous outlets teasing the release of the docs like it was an album drop. I'm not sure there was ever going to be a world where the release of something this salacious and politically charged was going to go smoothly, but coupled with an out of control X/Twitter and an essentially non-existent Google News made things much, much worse.

    "text": "Goodbye 2023!!! Read to the end for a good belly rub video I Am So Annoyed I Have To Write This After today, I'm going dark until the first week of January. If you need me, I'm reachable on email and I'll be lurking in the Discord, as well. The plan was to make today's issue a fun round up of stuff everyone liked in the Garbage Day Discord. And that's here too, further down below. But, unfortunately, it doesn't just get to be a bunch of fun stuff because Substack has, once again, stepped in it. I put a version of what I'm about to say here in the paid issue over the weekend, but after stewing on it - instead of enjoying the holidays!!!! - I decided I should put this in the main issue, as well. Substack's co-founder Hamish McKenzie posted a real bad statement this week about the platform's Nazi problem. A bunch of writers I respect are leaving the platform and I think I will be, as well. To be clear: I don't want to move actually. Substack, at least as a product, works incredibly well and there are lots of good people working there who have been super helpful over the last few years. But I don't think it's worth staying there anymore. I've tried to make the case a few different times as to how Substack should moderate themselves. I don't even think it's that complicated. But it goes nowhere and they clearly don't care. And so, at this point, I'm just annoyed. Substack is, essentially, my primary business partner and their pathological need to virtue signal to the worst people in the world is exhausting. And I am, frankly, sick of waking up every few months to deal with the fallout after they release a statement that pisses off all my readers. To put this in language they seem to value (more than moderation), they are, increasingly, making it harder to do business with them. Not only do they refuse to enforce literally their own terms of service, but they also can't stop blogging about it. If I had a chief technology officer who was constantly posting about people's right under the first amendment to sell Nazi memorabilia I w",

    "text": "Etsy is filling up with junk Read to the end for deep fried ham bomb Welcome to Garbage Weekend. It's the internet garbage you know and love, but in a format that's easier to read while you try and survive literally the most unnecessarily stressful days in modern life. PLATFORMS Substack has, once again, stepped in it. Substack's co-founder Hamish McKenzie posted a real bad statement this week about the platform's Nazi problem. Popehat has a good take on all of this , but here's what I'll say: I have given up trying to argue that moderation should matter and I am now just annoyed. Substack is, essentially, my primary business partner and their pathological need to virtue signal to the worst people in the world is exhausting. And I am, frankly, sick of waking up and having to deal with the fallout after they release a statement like this. So to put it in language they seem to value (more than moderation), they are, increasingly, making it harder to do business with them. If I had a chief technology officer who was constantly blogging about people's right under the first amendment to sell Nazi memorabilia I would feel the same way. So I'm going to think on this a bit more over the holidays, but if this is truly the path Substack wants to go down, then I'll have to find a new business partner. CES has not actually partnered with X? They aren't even paying for their verification lol. Etsy is filling up with junk. I actually noticed this recently. For the Garbage Day live events, I use a couple programs running on MIDI to play videos, show slides, etc., and went over to Etsy to see if I could find a custom controller I could use on stage and was shocked with how it has basically just turned into a worse version of Amazon. I'm not actually sure how you fix this other than, of course, stricter moderation, which, you know, no company ever wants to invest it (see above). But even then, it seems tricky because you'd have to verify exactly where products are coming from. I think the bigger takeaway is that the internet is an ecosystem and you c",

    "text": "The politics of cringe Read to the end for dog hate snowman The JoCat Debacle This story is a bit of a mess, so let me run through exactly what happened first before we get to any sort of deeper analysis. It all kicked off on December 12th, when X user @ZeroSuitCamus posted a video with the caption, \"Just made this video. Let me know what you think!\" The video was a short animation from the artist JoCat. You can watch it below: The @ZeroSuitCamus joke post was a classic Twitter gag. You find something your followers will immediately recognize as cringe and ironically claim that you made it. And @ZeroSuitCamus's followers knew exactly what to do. Their post has over a thousand replies and almost two thousand shares. And the majority are extremely vicious, with many going so far as to claim JoCat is a child abuser - for liking cartoons, I guess? Defining the groups involved here is tricky in the way defining any cluster of internet users never feels quite right, but I would broadly say that @ZeroSuitCamus and their followers are loose coalition of Weird Twitter users, trans shitposters, and dirtbag leftists (if those people even still exist). While JoCat's fans are, well, goofy YouTube nerds, adult cartoon fans, and queer gamers. By the end of the discourse cycle, @ZeroSuitCamus has since sorta-kinda apologized for the post, while also blaming JoCat for amplifying it in the first place. And JoCat published a lengthy blog post explaining the context behind the \"I Like Girls\" video. It was an inside joke , riffing on Lizzo's \"Boys\". \"I still want to make things, but perhaps I should just keep them to myself for the time being,\" JoCat wrote. \"I will be taking an indefinite break from posting anything online. It's a decision I've considered ever since the first hate wave from about a year or so ago but wanted to sit on it and see if the feeling would persist. I know now this is the best choice for me.\" I assumed our Bean Dad days were dying out with Twitter. And, to be clear, this is absolutely not at that level. But I also think ",
