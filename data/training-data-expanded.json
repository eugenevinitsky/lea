(rimshot) Welcome, fellow jarheads, to Tales from the jar side , the Kousen IT newsletter, for the week of January 4 - 11, 2026. This week I taught a training course on Integrating AI into Java projects on the O'Reilly Learning Platform. Thanks for reading Tales from the jar side! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. AI and Jevons Paradox According to Wikipedia, the Jevons paradox occurs when: In economics, the Jevons paradox ( /&#712;d&#658;&#603;v&#601;nz/ ; sometimes Jevons effect ) occurs when technological advancements make a resource more efficient to use &#8230; as the market cost of using the resource drops, &#8230; this results in overall demand increasing , causing total resource consumption to rise. [1] [2] [3] [4] In the IT world, that's like saying, \"as the price of producing software drops, the demand for software goes up.\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said this applies to AI as well. In a recent podcast, Simon Willison (one of the AI people I follow most closely) looked into his crystal ball and said: [Within 3 years] we will find out if the Jevons paradox saves our careers or not . This is a big question that anyone who's a software engineer has right now: we are driving the cost of actually producing working code down to a fraction of what it used to cost. Does that mean that our careers are completely devalued and we all have to learn to live on a tenth of our incomes, or does it mean that the demand for software, for custom software goes up by a factor of 10 and now our skills are even more valuable because you can hire me and I can build you 10 times the software I used to be able to? I think by three years we will know for sure which way that one went. I believe someone like Simon Willison, a working developer who uses AI tools every day, way more than I believe anything from some tech CEO who has a person stake in seeing AI succeed. Here's nano banana when I asked it to generate an image of a stochastic parrot, since that's what so",

Subscribe now Since 2017, companies linked to a multibillion-dollar investment manager in New York have spent at least $230 million buying up more than 80,000 acres across north Florida - amassing giant tracts of largely rural land near Jacksonville, St. Augustine, and Panama City. That same investment firm now wants Florida lawmakers to make it much easier to develop that land. Records obtained by Seeking Rents show that executives at Ruane Cunniff - a Manhattan-based firm that manages hedge funds, mutual funds and other investment vehicles - are behind an obscure entity pushing bills in the Florida Legislature this year that would enable giant landowners to have their properties rezoned for high-intensity development without a local public hearing or vote in the communities where the projects would occur. The Ruane Cunniff-backed company has hired nearly 20 lobbyists in Tallahassee who have been quietly meeting with lawmakers in support of the legislation - which, if passed, could dramatically boost the value of the vast land holdings the firm has assembled in Florida over the past decade. That's not all. Separate records show that another corporate entity controlled by Ruane Cunniff executives recently began showering money on key figures in the Florida Capitol. That entity has made more than $150,000 in campaign contributions in the two months since House Bill 299 and Senate Bill 354 were filed in the Legislature - including $10,000 api",

And that might be why searching legal cases is so costly, even in the age of AI. Introduction Hi there! My name is Tom Blakely, I'm a federal judicial law clerk and attorney. I previously worked in big law and the United States Department of Justice. You might remember me from last year, when I wrote about the US v. Google ad tech antitrust trial at Big Tech on Trial . I'm excited to be writing a guest piece for BIG, this time on a particular competition problem I (and nearly every lawyer) deals with on a daily basis: the Lexis/Westlaw duopoly. The law in America does not belong to lawyers, it belongs to all of us. As citizens, we must be able to read the law, understand it, obey it, and bring complaints against those who wrong us. That is the basis for a coherent political order, and why the rule of law is such a foundational aspect of a democratic system. Moreover, it would be hard to find a technological era more suited to the democratization of law than the one we're in today. The computer lets anyone query instantly, the internet lets anyone do it from anywhere, and generative artificial intelligence can decipher and explain complex legal questions if it has access to credible databases. And yet, today, two powerful companies dominate and restrain access to key aspects of our legal order, from case opinions to legislative history. To give you a sense of what I mean, Lexis, one of two dominant legal research platforms, charges up to $469 for a single search. That's the equivalent of a Google query, for almost $500. Moreover, beyond LexisNexis and its rival Westlaw, the Federal judiciary itself has used its privileged position to charge high fees for court records that should be available to all. Today, the law is hidden behind paywalls. But it wasn't always this way. In this piece, I'm going to explain how and why America keeps the law from its citizens, and what we can do about it. The Origins of Legal Research The stereotype of a lawyer's office was traditionally that of a well-manicured desk, with ornate and intimidating shelves of books ",

The first Mesopotamian cities did not emerge as neutral containers for human life; they were engineered systems that concentrated people, goods, and authority into forms that could be managed at scale. In southern Mesopotamia, especially in the Uruk and Early Dynastic periods, temples were central to that engineering. They were not only sites of worship but institutional hubs where storage, labor organization, craft production, land management, and adjudication converged, producing a durable urban hierarchy that could be experienced as both practical and sacred. The visual culture of early cities belongs inside this institutional story. Ziggurats, votive statues, cylinder seals, and administrative tablets were not separate categories of religious art, political art, or economic artifacts; they were interlocking technologies that made power legible, repeatable, and difficult to refuse. The temple precinct became a place where the divine was staged, but also where dependencies were created, recorded, and normalized through objects that fused belief with infrastructure. (The Met, Uruk: The First City; Pollock; Postgate) Temple institutions shaped the first cities by turning basic necessities into administrable flows. Urban growth demanded dependable routines. Grain must be stored, counted, milled, and distributed; animals must be herded, culled, and accounted for; textiles must be produced in predictable quantities; and labor must be scheduled across planting, harvesting, construction, and maintenance. In Mesopotamian lowland ecology, where large-scale irrigation and coordinated maintenance could make the difference between abundance and crisis, institutional capacity carried ideological weight. Temples concentrated surplus in storehouses and mobilized it through redistribution, which meant that economic survival increasingly passed through institutional hands. The result was not simply centralized wealth but a new social grammar. Access, rationing, and obligation beca",

If there's one thing a social scientist with a pet theory hates to hear more than \"correlation doesn't equal causation\", I don't know what it is 1 . We've long understood that well-designed and well-controlled randomized experiments are the best (and perhaps only) means of making causal conclusions from behavioral data 2 . Unfortunately, both ethics and convenience often prevent us from doing those randomized, controlled experiments. As such, for decades&#8230;really, as long as we've had inferential statistics&#8230;statisticians 3 have been trying to come up with new ways to wrest causation from correlational data. The result has been disaster for science communication. Indeed, even the earliest regression equations&#8230;fascinatingly dating even to the late 19 th century studies of \" pauperism \"&#8230;were used to argue for causation from correlational data. The argument then seems to be that, if a correlation persisted after controlling for theoretically relevant controls, than that persisting correlation must be causal. This, of course, made a lot of assumptions about the data, not only its reliability, but also that all theoretical controls could be identified and measured. Most of us today don't seriously think that basic regression equations allow us to make causal inferences. But some scholars simply move on to the next shiny toy arguing, \"no, seriously, ok, all those other approaches failed, sure, but THIS one, THIS one will let us assert causality from correlational data.\" And, of course, just like the attempts with regressions&#8230;they fail.

That sounds like a silly thing to say, but what it means is that what the entire economy of China is set up to do - scale up high-tech manufacturing businesses - is something that only one man in America knows how to do. Only Elon has built China-like manufacturing businesses in America, and he has done it twice now - SpaceX and Tesla. When something like that happens twice, it wasn't a coincidence. Just to give you an example of how important this is, note that without SpaceX, China would be leaving America in the dust when it comes to space launches. But with SpaceX, it's America leaving China in the dust: Source: @kenkirtland17 One implication of this is that America needs to make it a lot easier to set up and scale a manufacturing business , so that our entire high-tech manufacturing sector isn't dependent on one slightly kooky right-wing billionaire. But that's a topic for another post. A second implication is that if we want to know about the future of physical technology, we should listen to Elon Musk . In fact, Elon has a great track record of seeing and entering manufacturing industries that China zeroes in on later: This is a good list, but it omits the most important items. The three industries that Elon zeroed in on very early, which made him much of his fortune - and which China has subsequently gone all-in on - are batteries, electric vehicles, and solar power . In fact, he still thinks these technologies are some of the most important in the world. In a recent interview, Elon said : It seems like China listens to everything I say, and does it basically- or they're just doing it independently.

Photo: Mother Jones I received a notice in my newsfeed this morning that included links to videos of ICE agents arresting, and in several cases, viciously beating American citizens. These videos are hard to watch. Here is something else that's hard to do: putting a name on what's happening in this country right now with ICE arrests and demonstrations against them. It's tempting to say that the Trump administration, in the name of enforcing immigration laws, is waging a war on citizens. But it's not all citizens of America. It's only those in blue states like Minnesota and Oregon and Illinois and California. Trump is the first person in the 250-year history of this country who doesn't believe he was elected to be president of all the people. He says, and he acts, as if he is the president of those who voted for him. Everyone else, such as the people of Minneapolis, Minnesota, are enemies. They may as well be living in Iran or Venezuela, or be riding in open boats with multiple outboard motors racing through the Caribbean Sea. It's open season on everyone who didn't vote for Donald Trump, especially those who are showing up on the street to protest ICE efforts to arrest and deport undocumented immigrants. A great protest is taking place right now, but it's not like any protest we have seen before, such as those at the time of the killing of George Floyd or the mass protests against the Vietnam war. The protests are taking place one by one, against ICE agents, as they move in groups around cities in roundups of immigrants. American citizens are showing up, as they did the other day in Minneapolis, to protest the tactics of ICE. There is good reason for this, because what ICE is doing is clearly and inarguably unconstitutional. Vice President Vance said at least twice over the last few days that ICE agents will be \"going door to door\" in their roundup of undocumented immigrants.

GOP lawmakers in the state House announced this week the creation of the AI and Innovation Committee, headed by Rep. Justin Wilmeth. It's not clear yet exactly what legislation the committee hopes to advance, but lawmakers appeared to grasp how important AI regulations will be in the coming years. \"Artificial intelligence has become a powerful engine for our nation's economy, and it's here to stay,\" Wilmeth said in a news release. \"With the creation of the AI and Innovation Committee, the legislature is signaling that policymakers are evaluating their role in the future of Arizona: creating high-skill jobs, attracting new investment, and strengthening existing industries from semiconductors to healthcare.\" Wilmeth said he wants the committee to be a \"forum where experts, industry leaders, and members of the public can share their perspectives, knowledge, and concerns so we can create informed and effective legislation.\" Arizona lawmakers have dipped their toes into AI regulations before, including a few bills last year focused on deepfakes and the use of AI in health insurance claims, but they haven't tackled a wide range of issues raised by AI. Without clear rules from the Legislature, cities and counties have dealt with AI and the data centers that power AI on their own terms, while state officials stake out their own positions on AI policies and the Trump administration ramps up a nationwide effort to lead the global AI race.

    "text": "The One Simple Thing That Makes the U.S. Economy Unmanageable We used to be able to answer the question \"How much does that cost?\" But prices in America are not only high, but increasingly hidden. Fortunately, there's pushback. In 1956, CBS launched a new game show, The Price Is Right, in its daytime schedule. Contestants were presented with various objects, and the one who guessed closest to the actual retail price would win. The Price Is Right became the longest running game show in American history, because it spoke to a very casual yet deceptively important social question: How much does it cost? There's an important political assumption behind that question, which is that every retail item has one single price. And any buyer anywhere in America can pay that price to acquire it. Americans might have had different amounts of money, but they were all equal in that they paid the same amount for the same good. While a single price in a market might seem a natural state of affairs, and economists love presenting simple supply and demand curves assuming as much, there's nothing natural about it. In fact, a dense network of laws and norms created the notion of a single price for all buyers and sellers in a market, aka, The Price Is Right society. We no longer live in such a society, because the legal framework behind a single public price for an item has fallen apart. There are many examples, but the easiest way to understand this change is to look at health care markets, where hiding prices, and the consequences thereof, is most advanced. There Are No Real Prices In Health Care A few days ago, Hunterbrook, a short-seller funded media outfit, released an investigative report showing what looks like a multi-billion dollar money laundering operation by the three largest health insurance companies. The allegation is that CVS, UnitedHealth Group, and Cigna are supposed to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies for lower drug prices for their patients. But instead, they collude with those pharmaceutical companies to force higher drug prices, and split the profits with them. It's not a new charge.

These claims often defy what many people intuitively understand about the game. They're also a little bit exaggerated in order to get attention, but at the core point to an important truth.

Instead, I'm going to look at two claims on a philosophical level and why the general perception (what most people call \"the eye test\") and the numbers don't seem to agree. There is something that these two claims have in common; a bottomless individual skill floor and a fairly low ceiling at the highest level. Claim 1: Coaching doesn't matter The relative impact of coaching and whether or not a certain individual is a \"good\" coach or not takes up a massive amount of media space.

At the same time, there's not a lot of evidence that coaches can do all that much to impact the game. So what are the essential functions of a coach? Man management Game model Player selection Organizing training and periodization Media magnet Scapegoat Each of these contributes in various ways to the success of a team, to varying degrees. A manager who is bad at any of the initial functions sticks out, though. Each of these functions requires professionalism, organization, and sensitivity. These aren't common skills and require practice and experience. It's also noticeable when they are lacking. At the same time, the pressures of the job very quickly filter out any manager who can't cut it.

    "text": "A reply to critics on American oil and gas Warning: This is very long because I'm trying to be thorough. On December 18, I published an op-ed in the New York Times arguing that Democrats should approach the American oil and gas industry more like successful center-left coalitions in Norway, Canada, and Mexico do with their own fossil fuel industries. That is to say, broadly speaking, that Democrats should invest money and political capital in trying to reduce consumption of fossil fuels - especially by promoting technological changes that move the needle on global emissions - rather than in trying to stifle domestic production. The argument is in part political. Mark Carney and Claudia Sheinbaum have totally different political styles, but neither thinks it would be viable to win elections in resource-rich countries while opposing their countries' natural resource industries. Jared Polis, Michelle Lujan Grisham, and Josh Shapiro are the governors of the three blue states where fossil fuel extraction is most economically important, and they all support their states' fossil fuel industries. And no one's going to win in redder states like Ohio, Alaska, and Texas with a stance that's to the left of Democrats in Colorado, New Mexico, and Pennsylvania. And since there's no path to a Senate majority that doesn't involve winning those redder states, the national party may as well stop banging its head against the wall of an impossible supply-side agenda and focus on what it can achieve. But my argument is also substantive. I genuinely think that a prudent approach to managing American fossil fuel resources is preferable to treating the oil and gas industry like cigarette manufacturers. Burning fossil fuels creates significant amounts of pollution, both particulates and greenhouse gases. This is a problem that needs to be addressed, but a genuinely prudent approach involves both holding the industry to a high standard in terms of things like methane leaks and electrification of the actual extraction operations, and then also pushing for the resulting cleaner fossil fuels to be ",

    "text": "Hey, What Are All These Books Doing To Us? And is everything about to change? Hello again! Today's the last day of the end-of-season offer for Everything Is Amazing - and it's time to explain what's coming for paid subscribers in the upcoming season. If I may, I'd like to introduce you to a book that's very special to me. Every year at this time (it's my birthday today), I like to sit by a window and read it for a while, to remind myself how ludicrously subjective the term \"old\" is. The spine crackles as you open it, and the pages have a musty scent that's so complicated it could only be the product of decades of moving through the world, soaking up the smells of so many different rooms and their furnishings and occupants, until it's become a piece of 20th-Century olfactory archaeology. (Yes, that term refers to a real branch of research ! No, I didn't know this either.) And its author? It's the work of an entrepreneurial young journalist writer from London, whose stuff you really should read. Sketches By Boz is a series of 56 portraits of Londoners and their environment, a mixture of the true and fictional, accompanied by beautiful illustrations, and eventually bundled together into&#8230;well, this: Boz didn't have any problems marketing this book: pretty much all the major London newspapers and magazines eagerly agreed to run many of these \"sketches\" in their pages because they were already wildly popular. (Think of it as a British semi-fictionalised version of Humans Of New York , with a similar level of fame for its time). However, that wasn't Boz's master-stroke. Seeing the massive potential for serialized content like this, he'd been working on another title - a wholly fictional story he was eagerly writing his way into. But instead of choosing to publish that as a book, he drew on his journalism experience to release each new segment of the story as a separately printed pamphlet, a &#8216;column' printed outside of a newspaper, and sold for the equivalent of the price of a beverage.

If peace requires preparation for war, then: mistrust is rational, suspicion is intelligent, escalation is responsible \"Si vis pacem, para bellum\" : a sentence that poisoned the idea of peace \" If you want peace, prepare for war \" sounds prudent. Almost wise. That's precisely why it has been so destructive. This phrase did three deep things to the human mind : It redefined peace as an absence of attack , not a shared condition. Peace ceased to be something built together and became something imposed through fear . You are \"at peace\" not because interests are aligned, but because the other side is afraid to move. That is not peace. That is a truce under threat. It normalized permanent hostility by creating a world where every actor must assume bad faith , because failing to do so is framed as na&#239;vet&#233; or weakness. Over time, this becomes self-fulfilling: everyone behaves aggressively because everyone expects aggression. It doesn't prevent war. It makes war structurally inevitable . It fused security with domination. From Rome to modern empires, \"para bellum\" justified arms races, military&#8211;industrial complexes, proxy wars, deterrence doctrines that accept mass civilian death as a \"cost\"&#8230; Security stopped being about safety and became about superiority . The Cold War is the clearest example: humanity survived not because the paradigm worked, but because we got lucky - repeatedly. Deterrence did not create peace; it created suspended catastrophe . Negotiation became secondary, even suspicious. Talking was something you did after weapons were ready, not instead of them. As a result, diplomats lost influence, military logic dominated political thinking and compromise became synonymous with weakness. Trillions were spent on preparing for destruction instead of climate resilience, global health, education, shared technological advancement&#8230; The tragedy is not just moral - it's civilizational misallocation . It taught generations that violence is the ultimate language, and a world prepared for war became a world trained in confrontation . An obsolete and dangerous p",

For his entire second term, Donald Trump has been grousing about Fed Chair Jerome Powell's resistance to cutting interest rates, but he has always stopped short of actually trying to run Powell out of office-until now. On Sunday, the Federal Reserve released a direct-to-camera video from Powell. In it, he said the Department of Justice has served the Fed with subpoenas and threatened a criminal indictment over alleged cost overruns for renovations at the Fed building. It's an excuse Trump has been using for going after Powell since last summer . In his video, Powell-who has gone about his business and ignored Trump's increasingly ominous rhetoric for a year-dropped all pretense. \"This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress's oversight role; the Fed through testimony and other public disclosures made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts,\" Powell said. \"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president.\" And here's the thing: No one is really disputing it.

    "text": "A Blueprint For A Machine That Cures/Defeats HIV By Destroying It This is my own idea I've had it for years. Now I am posting a blueprint and everything. My name is Dan Pavlosky from Lyndhurst NJ. It's heavily implied to be a real one here The Electric Sieve: A Dielectrophoretic Cure for HIV By Dani Pavlosky We have been looking at the problem of HIV wrong. We have been trying to poison it with pills or hide it with suppressants. But HIV is a physical object. It has mass, it has a size (roughly 120 nanometers), and crucial to this design-it has a specific electrical charge. If it's a physical object, it can be moved. If it can be moved, it can be removed. This is the blueprint for a device that doesn't just treat the virus-it tunes into it and extracts it. The Core Tech: Dielectrophoresis (DEP) Forget magnets for a second. We are moving to currents. Every biological particle-a red blood cell, a T-cell, and the HIV virus itself-has a unique \"dielectric signature.\" It vibrates and moves differently when hit with specific electrical frequencies. This is called Dielectrophoresis (DEP) . HIV particles carry a negative surface charge (Zeta Potential of ~ -20mV). By creating a non-uniform electric field and \"tuning\" the frequency specifically to the virus, we can create a physical force that pushes the virus away from healthy cells. It acts like an invisible sorter: Blood cells go left, HIV goes right. The Device: The \"Wand & Cartridge\" System The therapy works in two aggressive stages, designed to scrub the body clean. Phase 1: The Wand (The Deep Tissue Mobilizer) We use a handheld device, styled like a medical ultrasound probe, but it emits Nano-Pulse Electrical Fields. Target: Organs where the virus hides (the Brain, Pancreas, Lymph Nodes). Action: The wand directs ultra-short, high-voltage pulses tuned to the resonance of the viral reservoirs. It doesn't cook the tissue; it shocks the infected \"root cells,\" forcing them to dump their viral load into the bloodstream or undergo apoptosis (cell death). Result: The hiding virus is flushed out into the open. Phase 2: The Loop (The Extraction) This is the \"Saving Private Ryan\" moment. The patient is hooked up to an extracorporeal unit (like a dialysis machine)",

    "text": "Two Weeks into Iran’s Protest Wave: A New Phase Anti-regime protests in Iran have now lasted for two weeks, and in recent days they appear to have entered a new phase. Anti-regime protests in Iran have now lasted for two weeks, and in recent days they appear to have entered a new phase. In my previous post , published on the fifth day, I reflected on the initial geography of unrest and compared it with Iran's earlier protest waves. The current episode began with shopkeepers in Tehran's Grand Bazaar, where slogans supporting the Pahlavi monarchy were also heard. Over the following days, protests spread primarily to Persian-speaking districts as well as Lor and Caspian areas. Meanwhile, Kurdish, Azeri, Baluchi, Arab, and Sunni-majority districts were largely absent or only weakly represented during the initial phase-consistent with their limited sympathy for monarchist slogans and with longer-standing political tensions between monarchist currents and marginalized ethnolinguistic constituencies. Thanks for reading Popular Politics, Unbound! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. Some commentators quickly framed the protests as driven mainly by economic deprivation. And indeed, from Lor districts, protests did spread into deprived Kurdish areas of Ilam, such as Abdanan, Ilam, and Malekshahi. But the economic explanation alone cannot account for the early geography of the unrest. Other deeply impoverished regions-most notably in Sistan and Baluchestan-did not join the protests in the initial phase. What mattered, in addition to deprivation, was ethnic identity as well as proximity to early protest sites. As scholars of revolutions and social movements have long emphasized, once a contentious episode begins, diffusion dynamics can accelerate participation beyond what structural conditions alone would predict-through inspiration, shared emotions, and the rapid spread of information. A second trigger: violence and moral outrage A key turning point came with reports of security forces attacking a hospital in Ilam (and separately in Tehran). This incident appears to have served as a second trigger, creating moral outr",

    "text": "LLM poetry and the \"greatness\" question Experiments by Gwern and Mercor I have been looking at the ability of large language models (LLMs) to write poetry for more than five years . With every new model, the technical abilities improve: pro models can produce lines and stanzas, handle rhyme and meter, and create surprising and witty turns of phrase, produce impressive metaphors. Technique is not the problem. Does any LLM output rise to the level of good poetry, or even great poetry? It's a different question than studies about favorable ratings ask. I'm interested in greatness, what it is, and can LLMs get there. My definition of \"great\" poetry, which I've used over thirty years of reading, teaching, and writing poetry, is simple: a great poem is both particular and universal. A great poem is \"about\" a specific person or moment embedded in a particular culture, composed in such a way that it reaches across time and distance to resonate with readers outside that culture. Poets work inside an historical network of existing poems. A new poem resonates when it activates prior reading in the mind of the reader. Lines and images from older work resonate with each other and with new work. That resonance is the mechanism by which the particular becomes universal. LLMs are trained on existing texts. LLMs have in their training data most of the digitized poetry in existence; their output tends to reflect patterns in that data. A model asked to write a poem about grief will draw upon images and phrasings about grief in earlier poems. ( Primer on vector embeddings.) But LLMs do not yet, at this writing, have culture. Without culture, I'm not sure there can be great poetry. Gwern If anyone can crack this nut, it is my favorite thinker on how exactly LLMs and poetry work: Gwern . His recent experiments using LLMs to write formal verse in the Pindaric mode \"on the occasion of visiting a biomedical lab and watching the release of unnecessary mice ,\" to \"complete\" a poem by William Empson, and to write a romantic poem are, in my view, required reading f",

    "text": "How to Turn Your Resume Into a Narrative Alexandra Aileru, career counselor Courtesy of Alexandra Aileru A lot of aspiring and early career journalists struggle with crafting a resume. But it might help if you thought of it less as a collection of job titles and more like an alternative-story form for the narrative of your career. We talked with career counselor Alexandra Aileru, founder of Confident Career Switch, about resumes. What is the purpose of a resume? The purpose of a resume is to clearly and professionally communicate the value you bring, using past experiences, measurable outcomes, and honed skills as evidence. It allows recruiters and hiring managers to quickly decide whether to begin or continue a conversation with you. A strong resume translates your experience into language the employer understands, especially if you have a non-linear or early-career background. What is the biggest mistake you see people make with resumes? The biggest mistake is a weak or unclear career narrative. Many people list roles without first reviewing their achievements, skills, and values, then selecting what is most relevant to the role they're applying for. When the story isn't clear, hiring managers are forced to guess-and that usually ends the conversation. Never assume an employer understands your background; your resume should explain it clearly to someone encountering it for the first time. How are companies using AI to read resumes? How should applicants respond? Companies use AI to scan resumes for relevant keywords, skills, and patterns, which means applicants need to optimize for both technology and humans. Use role-specific language, simple formatting, and measurable outcomes, ideally following a structure such as what you did, the impact (with metrics), and how you did it. Keywords should always be used accurately and in context, or they will be flagged later in screening or interviews. For early-career students with little experience, what should go on a resume? Early-career resumes should show direction. Students should include cour",

(Photo Illustration by Mateusz Slodkowski/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Elon Musk's AI chatbot, Grok, has drawn backlash and calls for investigations from governments around the world after it produced non-consensual, sexualized images of children and women last week. The images were disseminated after users on X, the Musk-owned social media site that features Grok as an integrated feature, asked the chatbot to generate nude or partially nude photos of real people that were then publicly shared on the platform.

Plus, Gavin Newsom raises electricity prices in California, the FTC sues Uber, and TikTok gets fake sold. Things are going to slow down this week and next, since it's Christmas, but there was lots of monopoly related news this week. What looks like a fake sale of TikTok was announced, the FTC sued Uber, and a former FTC enforcer exposed private equity's role in youth sports. Before getting to the round-up, I want to focus on three events that unmask some behind-the-scenes villains in the Trump era, as well as the pushback that's happening behind the scenes. Let's start with the villains. As we know, both Netflix and Paramount are seeking to buy Warner Bros Discovery for $100B+, in order to consolidate Hollywood. Paramount owner David Ellison openly told Donald Trump he'll change CNN if allowed to buy the firm, in order to get permission to buy the firm. Netflix's CEO Ted Sarandos also met with Trump, and no doubt that plus antitrust lawyer Steve Sunshine's political analysis is why the Warner board agreed to sell to that bid. Well, a few days ago, the Wall Street Journal and Politico reported that both Netflix and Paramount are employing the same lobbying firm, Ballard Partners, where both Attorney General Pam Bondi and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles used to work. Ballard is the lobbying funnel for most major corporate deals under Trump, and has a strong whiff of corruption around it. Several Senators are demanding Bondi recuse herself. But basically, everyone in corporate America is openly saying they can use a fat envelope to overcome that pesky rule of law thing, and Ballard seems like the post office for these fat envelopes. The thing is, surrounding all of these deals aren't just lobbyists, but oodles of antitrust lawyers. Well-credentialed, well-paid corporate lawyers. Corporate lawyers who have all sworn an oath to the Constitution, to the courts, and to honesty and virtue in their representation of clients before the law, who are in good standing with the American Bar Association Antitrust Section.

Twenty-six additional measles cases were reported in South Carolina, centered around Spartanburg County in the current outbreak since last Friday. This brings the outbreak total to 211. Nineteen of the new cases were associated with exposures in known households and previously reported school exposures. Four resulted from an exposure at church. The source of one case is unknown, and two are still being investigated. Image/CDC There are currently 144 people in quarantine and seven in isolation. The latest end of quarantine for these is January 28. Based on the new cases, DPH has identified public exposures at two schools: Sugar Ridge Elementary and Boiling Springs Elementary and began notifying potentially exposed students, faculty and staff on Dec. 31. There are currently nine students in quarantine from these schools. Churches where exposures occurred include Tabernacle of Salvation Church, Slavic Pentecostal Church of Spartanburg, Unitarian Universalist Church of Spartanburg, and Ark of Salvation Church. Four people in this outbreak, including adults and children, required hospitalization for complications of the disease. Additional cases required medical care for measles but were not hospitalized.

When we walk about anal pleasure, we often position it within a frame of active engagement - or, you know, getting one's ass fucked*. When I was reading The Surrender , it struck me as odd that even as Bentley waxes romantic about the first man to putt his penis up her asshole, she casually tosses aside mentions of other, earlier experiences of anal penetration. The fingers, the tongues, the vibrators that entered her ass: those are all written off as no big deal: it's the man whose member opened her asshole who she really wants to center in her story; it's the episodes of a penis penetrating her ass that warrant obsessive documentation. I don't particularly care for that framing, not least because it hews to this idea of the primacy of penile penetration that has shaped toxic notions like, ugh, virginity. While I certainly think that taking a dick up the ass is a different experience of anal pleasure than some of its counterparts, I don't find it helpful to position it as the pinnacle of anal pleasure or intimacy. I think it is just one way of experiencing the ass.

    "text": "Reflections on Vibe Researching My year-long experiment in AI first research I tried that prompt (and nothing more than it) this morning with ChatGPT 5.2 Pro and it actually produced an entire paper. Here it is . I have no idea what it is saying or whether it is complete nonsense or not. But it took 19 minutes and 10 seconds to produce. To be clear, ChatGPT didn't think it was a publishable paper and that it needed more work. So I decided to ask Gemini if the paper made any sense and it said: The paper is scientifically coherent. It identifies a genuine gap in a top-tier paper (the computational slowness of OT-GMM) and applies the correct mathematical tool (Debiased Sinkhorn) to fix it. If implemented, this would likely be a publishable contribution in econometrics. I'll leave it to others to work that all out. For the moment, let me reflect on my own more serious attempts at &#8216;vibe researching.' The first reasoning LLM (ChatGPT-o1-pro) came out just over a year ago. It was the first model that opened up the possibility of using AI write at the start and through the process of a research project, all the way through to publication of results. I ran a little experiment in what I guess would now be called \"vibe researching,\" which took an idea I had long had (a fairly non-serious one) to see if I could, with the use of o1-pro produce a publishable paper in less than an hour. The answer turned out to be &#8216;yes,' and the paper was published in Economics Letters as I recounted here . I make no claims that it is a great paper. It is far from that. Indeed, I could improve it markedly now, but that wasn't the point. This led me to worry about what the future of research might look like and whether there was any point to research at all - why speculate and produce research that might be useful when people could just ask for research to be done on specific problems they had? The only way to answer these questions, it seemed to me, was to really go for it and see what jumping all in on AI-first research could do to my own productivity. I had l",

    "text": "Monopoly Round-Up: Why Did Trump Just Attack the Fed and Corporate America? Donald Trump pledged to crack down on Wall Street ownership of housing, credit card giants, and defense contractors. And he attacked the Fed. It's the year of affordability. But is the agenda real? Lots of monopoly related news, as usual. Google is now emailing children to tell them how to avoid parental controls, a price war brought down the price of weight loss drugs, there's cool innovation by Lego toys, and the Trump administration actually blocked a merger! Before getting to that, let's focus on how Trump is managing the problem of affordability and politics. Over the past week, we got a clearer idea how this administration will set itself up for the midterm elections. The President announced attempts to crack down on credit card companies, big landlords, and defense contractors, and his administration is now pursuing a high-profile criminal investigation of the Chair of the Federal Reserve, Jay Powell. The moves are all happening, more or less, because of an increasing panic in the White House over high prices, as the President sees that the public is unhappy with his performance. In short, a key political theme of the next year for the Trump administration and the Democratic opposition is affordability, with a lot of rhetoric of cracking down on wayward corporations. Will it work? Is it sincere? That's the lens I'm going to use in looking at the events of the past week. To answer these questions, I'll observe another less noticed move last week that I find more significant. The Justice Department waived through a multi-billion real estate brokerage merger in what looks like a corrupt deal to create a home buying monopoly. Though few noticed this deal, it is one of many below-the-radar choices that will likely raise consumer costs. There is, in other words, tension between the announced agenda and the real one. From Make America Wealthy Again to Affordability Ok, let's start with the political context. The theme of the President's domestic economic policy in his first year was not affordability, it was, in Trump's words, Make America Wealthy Again .

    "text": "Why Venezuelan Oil May Not Be a 'Great Revenue Source' Unless...  The Goal is to Boost the Construction Industry Venezuela holds some of the world's largest proven oil reserves, primarily located in the Orinoco Belt. On paper, this seems like a recipe for enormous revenue. However, the reality is far more complex. The majority of Venezuelan crude is heavy or extra-heavy oil , characterized by high viscosity, elevated sulfur content, and significant amounts of metals such as nickel and vanadium. These properties make it difficult and expensive to refine into conventional fuels like gasoline or diesel, limiting its attractiveness for traditional petroleum markets. Refining heavy crude requires advanced technology and substantial capital investment. Processes such as coking, hydrocracking, and hydrogenation are necessary to convert heavy fractions into lighter, saleable fuels. Setting up such facilities is not only costly-often running into billions of dollars-but also technically demanding. Additionally, Venezuelan political instability and international sanctions introduce further financial and operational risks. For many foreign investors, these factors make deep refining ventures economically unattractive, especially when simpler and safer alternatives exist. Thanks for reading Sherlock's Substack! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. One of the most practical uses of Venezuelan heavy oil is in the construction industry , primarily as asphalt or bitumen for roads and roofing. Heavy crude is naturally rich in asphaltens and other high-molecular-weight components, making it ideal for these applications with minimal processing. Unlike fuel production, creating construction-grade products requires relatively low capital investment and yields a stable demand, especially in emerging markets with ongoing infrastructure projects. The high sulfur content or viscosity of the crude is not a major problem in these contexts, unlike in the production of gasoline or diesel. Other potential uses, such as industrial fuel oil or bunker fuel for ships, face increasing re",

    "text": "How RFK Jr. Cherry Picks Science When “insufficient data” gets twisted into “vaccines don’t work” One of the most effective rhetorical tricks in modern health misinformation isn't inventing fake studies, it's misusing real ones. In a recent interview with CBS News , Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claims that a Cochrane review shows the flu vaccine does not reduce the risk of severe disease in children. On its face, that sounds authoritative. Cochrane is widely respected. However, when you look closely, what RFK Jr. is doing isn't evidence-based critique, it's selective framing designed to turn \"absence of data\" into \"proof of failure.\" The Cochrane Collaboration review he's referring to does not conclude that flu vaccines fail to prevent severe disease in children. What it actually says is far less sensational: randomized controlled trials were not designed or powered to measure rare outcomes like hospitalization, ICU admission, or death in otherwise healthy children. That's not a dismissal of vaccine benefit; it's a basic statistical reality. When severe outcomes are uncommon, even very effective interventions won't show statistically significant differences in trials that enroll a few thousand participants. Cochrane is transparent about this limitation. RFK Jr. strips that nuance away. This is the pattern: take a cautious methodological statement and rebrand it as a negative finding. \"We do not have sufficient data to measure X\" becomes \"there is no evidence for X.\" Those are not equivalent statements, and anyone trained in clinical research knows it. The former invites further study and broader evidence synthesis. The latter is a rhetorical endpoint designed to imply failure where none has been demonstrated. Crucially, Cochrane reviews are not meant to be the sole arbiter of public health policy. They privilege randomized trials by design, which makes sense for questions of efficacy against infection or mild illness. However, severe pediatric influenza outcomes are rare events, and rare events are usually detected through observational data, surveillance systems, and ",

He devastated Venezuela's economy by continuing all the worst aspects of the irresponsible economic policies of his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, reducing much of his population to abject poverty. He stole elections, suppressed dissent, and killed many thousands of regime opponents. Venezuelans are unlikely to mourn his removal from power at the hands of Donald Trump's lighting raid on January 3rd. And yet Maduro's capture has suddenly thrown much of the world into chaos and uncertainty. Trump ordered the U.S. Military to abduct a foreign head of state without Congressional authorization - a naked display of power in defiance of every international norm that had prevailed since World War 2. The geopolitical implications of that fact are going to reverberate a lot more than the abduction itself. A little over two years ago, in the aftermath of the October 7th attacks in Israel, I wrote that Pax Americana was effectively dead: The world is a more ungoverned, lawless place than it was 20 or even 10 years ago&#8230;The world is starting to revert into a jungle, where the strong prey upon the weak, and where there is a concomitant requirement that every country build up its own strength; if your neighbor is a tiger, you should probably grow some claws of your own.

If an electric car factory opens near you, that factory may use just as much water as a data center . The factory also requires careful planning. But the idea that either the factory or AI is using an inordinate amount of water that merits any kind of boycott or national attention as a unique serious environmental issue is innumerate. Individual data centers can sometimes stress local water systems in the way other industries do, but when you use AI, you are not contributing to a significant problem for water management compared to most other things you do in your day to day life. On the national, local, and personal level, AI is barely using any water, and unless it grows 50 times faster than forecasts predict, this won't change. I'm writing from an American context and don't know as much about other countries. But at least in America, the numbers are clear and decisive. The idea that AI's water usage is a serious national emergency caught on for three reasons: People get upset at the idea of a physical resource like water being spent on a digital product, especially one they don't see value in, and don't factor in just how often this happens everywhere. People haven't internalized how many other people are using AI. AI's water use looks ridiculous if you think of it as a small marginal new thing. It looks tiny when you divide it by the hundreds of millions of people using AI every day. People are easily alarmed by contextless large numbers, like the number of gallons of water a data center is using. They compare these large numbers to other regular things they do, not to other normal industries and processes in society. They aren't aware of how much water society uses on other normal industries.

As I mentioned in the last edition, I thought we'd see an uptick in news this week, and that certainly proved to be the case and then some. There's a lot to cover, so let's dive right in! Reds Expected To Sign RHP Pierce Johnson On Sunday afternoon, Jon Heyman posted on X that the Reds were signing free agent right-handed reliever Pierce Johnson. Gordon Wittenmyer of the Cincinnati Enquirer later confirmed Heyman's report, stating that the deal is for one year and is pending a physical. Johnson, 34, has spent the last two and a half seasons pitching for the Braves, where he never posted an ERA higher than 3.67. In 65 games, covering 59 innings out of the bullpen for Atlanta in 2025, Johnson recorded a 3.05 ERA with a 3.91 FIP. Johnson is a three-pitch pitcher, utilizing a curveball, four-seam fastball, and cutter. He has thrown his curveball 72 percent of the time in both the 2024 and 2025 seasons. Johnson has also shown the ability to generate swing and miss, posting above league average Whiff% and strikeout rates in each of the last six seasons. Additional terms of Johnson's contract were not available at the time of this post. Arbitration Agreements Last Thursday marked the deadline for teams and their arbitration-eligible players to exchange salary figures. The Reds had 11 arbitration eligible players and were able to reach agreements with nine of them.

    "text": "Genuine Digital Security at the Network Level Has Always Been Available The prevailing cybersecurity landscape is built on a fundamental contradiction: it thrives on managing breaches rather than preventing them. The prevailing cybersecurity landscape is built on a fundamental contradiction: it thrives on managing breaches rather than preventing them. Billions of dollars flow annually into products and services designed to detect, respond, and mitigate the damage caused by cybersecurity failures. This entrenched model accepts breaches as inevitable, focusing on risk management instead of genuine security. The result is an industry that perpetuates insecurity while claiming to safeguard against it. At the core of this systemic failure lies a critical flaw in how identity and authentication are understood. Current public-access authentication methods rely primarily on data, passwords, tokens, biometric records, that serve as proxies for identity. These credentials are transmitted, stored, and verified repeatedly, creating an expansive attack surface vulnerable to theft, replication, and misuse. Authentication in this context does not confirm the actual existence of the person claiming an identity but rather verifies possession of data associated with that identity. This distinction is crucial and often overlooked. The failure to incorporate existence as a factor in authentication means that systems operate on assumptions: that credentials are accurate, legitimate, and possessed by the rightful user. These assumptions are inherently fragile. Credentials can be stolen, guessed, or forged; biometric data can be duplicated or spoofed; and tokens can be intercepted. Consequently, identity theft, unauthorized access, and breaches caused by weak authentication persist as endemic problems. A transformative approach to digital security demands a redefinition of authentication itself. Instead of verifying identity through data, security must verify the actual, physical presence of the user in real time. This principle, Existence-as-a-Factor (EaaF), positions existence verification as the foundational element of trust. By confirming that the individual is genuinely present and the rightf",

Spoiler alert. - Kate Embedded, however, is forever: New on ICYMI: Are those Meta Glasses you're wearing, or are you just happy to see me??? Head over here to subscribe to ICYMI wherever you listen to podcasts &#129782; Most New Year's resolutions are cliche. The pursuit of a \"better\" body, or a well-read mind, is seemingly timeless. But this time of year is always helpful for taking a temperature check on the culture, and 2026's reading is loud and clear: Everyone wants off their phones. This isn't a particularly new desire, but something about this year feels different. Instead of broadly gesticulating that we want to be better, the crackdown is coming from all angles. People I know are buzzing about Brick, the physical device that locks you out of certain apps on your phone; the concept of going \"analog\" has become so trendy other people are getting annoyed with it. There's the New York Times 's 2026 predictions , which include \"dumb phones as status symbols,\" a \"war on slop,\" and \"the rise of exfluencers.\" The Washington Post claims \"phone-free bars\" are in. Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, says sharing personal moments to the feed \" is dead .\" Students in New York City and New Jersey are seeing benefits from bans on phones in schools. I don't think we've hit this tipping point because we suddenly wanted it enough, or that this will be the year we all come together and get more disciplined. Instead, I think we just left a year when social media got fundamentally less interesting. The only reason cutting down on screen time was ever hard was because we wanted to look at our phones. But over the past few months, as I methodically opened and closed my stable of apps, I slowly realized just how long it's been since I found what I was looking for.

I don't have any podcasts for you this week, but an episode of \"Doom Debates\" with Liron Shapira will be coming out soon. 1. Why Abundance is good for small business It always seemed a bit silly that some of the antitrust people decided to start a rhetorical fight with the Abundance people. After all, market power decreases abundance (since there's a deadweight loss from monopoly). So theoretically these folks should be on the same side. But for whatever reason, some folks still insist on seeing a contradiction here. For example, Austin Ahlman asks how the Abundance movement will help a small businessperson trying to revitalize his hometown: And Zephyr Teachout asks what Abundance can offer to small pharmacists struggling in the face of competition from big chains: I don't sneer at questions like these; they are good and important questions. I'm a big supporter of small business , which I view as a pillar of the middle class, a provider of variety, and a positive force in urban politics. So I definitely want policies that support it. In fact, the Abundance idea has a huge amount to offer small businesses. For example, let's answer Teachout's question first. Pharmacies face a huge number of regulatory barriers. It's expensive, difficult, and time-consuming to get a permit to open a pharmacy. Renovating a space costs a lot of money and requires more onerous approvals and permits. There's plenty of laborious labor regulation that raises the cost of hiring workers. And so on. These costs function as barriers to entry for businesses. Big chain pharmacies like CVS and Walgreens can easily pay those costs and take the required time; in fact, they've already budgeted the costs in. But for small independent pharmacies, these regulatory costs and delays are a huge burden. This puts a thumb on the scale for the big chains, making it ",

Instead, the president flat out got away with it. And now he will never face federal criminal charges for trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election or removing highly classified documents from the White House and hiding them at his Palm Beach resort. We've waited a long time for former special counsel Jack Smith to tell us what evidence he amassed against Trump. And now we know at least part of that picture. His recent matter-of-fact recounting of his comprehensive investigations only whets the appetite for the whole story. The famously tight-lipped Smith, who led two investigations into Trump and secured two indictments, testified before the House Judiciary Committee on December 17. Surprise! Smith's deposition, a robust defense of his investigations, was reported in the media. But The New York Times, for example, ran its piece on page A19 of the print edition of the paper, because the closed-door hearing was free of reporters and no video recording or transcript of the exhaustive eight-hour testimony was made available. Until December 31. After ignoring calls from Smith's lawyers to release the transcript, Rep. Jim Jordan, the chairman of the committee, decided to dump the 255-page transcript after everyone had gone home for the New Year. Smith, who was subpoenaed to appear, asked for a public hearing. Surprisingly, so did the president. \"I'd rather see him testify publicly, because there's no way he can answer the questions.\" Actually, he did &#8211; at least all the questions he was not barred by a Trump-appointed judge from answering. The reason for the closed session was that Republicans were concerned Smith would use the hearing as a platform to divulge heretofore unreleased information. Smith withstood a barrage of q",

Here are the most important revelations. Sam Altman spoke candidly and substantively about his plans for OpenAI in an hour-long conversation on Big Technology Podcast this week ( Apple Podcasts , Spotify , or YouTube ). And as we spoke, I started to get a picture of what OpenAI's future might look like. Altman was candid about OpenAI's plans to build deeper memory into ChatGPT, how it will handle more people forming emotional bonds with the bot, and when an OpenAI IPO might be coming. Following our conversation, here are seven big thoughts about OpenAI's strategy and where it's heading, starting with that memory feature: ChatGPT Will Remember You, And That's a Potential Moat For OpenAI Altman's vision for ChatGPT's memory is ambitious, aiming for the bot to remember almost everything about us if we choose. \"Even if you have the world's best personal assistant, they can't remember every word you've ever said in your life. They can't have read every email. They can't have read every document you've ever written,\" he told me. \"AI is definitely gonna be able to do that.\" If OpenAI is able to build \"infinite, perfect memory,\" as Altman put it, that could change the ChatGPT experience in a dramatic way. The bot, for instance, could remember decisions you consulted it on in the past, consider the outcomes, and advise you on current choices. There will be serious privacy considerations to wrestle with as well. But should the plan work, the switching cost to leave ChatGPT could be extremely high. Altman believes people will get to know an AI bot, invest in it, and then stick around. With memory, ChatGPT could have a lock in. Lots of People Will Build Relationships With ChatGPT As OpenAI improves ChatGPT for consumers - building in EQ and memory - many people are going to build relationships with it. Altman said he was surprised by how many people already want to form a bond with the bot. \"People like their AI chatbot to get to know them and be warm to them and be supportive,\" he told me.

But instead of publishing the final part as a fourth post, I figured I'd just publish the entire new section as a single post. So here you go! This is the entire new section of my book. It's about a big idea for how to partially reverse the economic stagnation that has gripped Japan since the late 2000s. Part I: I want the Japanese future back! Japan lost the future in 2008, not in 1990 When I lived in Japan in the mid-2000s, it still felt very much like \"the future\". 3g flip-phones with grainy cameras were far more advanced than anything I had encountered in the U.S. Japanese people had LCD or plasma TVs, while most Americans were still using old cathode-ray machines. Their kitchens had automatic rice-cookers and other appliances I had never seen, and their laptops were higher-performance and far more durable than the ones I had used in the U.S. Their toilets were like something from a spaceship, and their showers could dry clothing.

(CBS/Screenshot) Share Subscribe now The Golden Globes were a complete and total embarrassment. Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying this as a stuffy, sanctimonious believer that awards are things only legitimately bestowed upon artists by academies and properly credentialed critics groups. The \"legitimacy\" of any group to hand out trophies is more or less in the eye of the beholder. But once they are rolling, you can judge them by how seriously they take their project. Last week, I spent hours on the phone with a reporter from outside Hollywood who was genuinely trying to understand concerns about the Golden Globes. We went around in circles as she asked repeatedly: Aren't all these shows a bit of a joke? Can you really take them so seriously to get all upset about one of them? Every molecule of my body longed to agree with that&#8230; to just say, \"Yes! It's all a big silly joke! Who indeed, does care if the Golden Globes are corrupt and ridiculous? Let's just see some stars in nice clothes crying when they accept prizes and not strain ourselves making too much of this.\" But, but, but&#8230;. Watching the show last night had the ironic effect, in its awfulness, of reminding me why this whole thing matters, as silly as that sounds. Film, as you may have heard, is under assault at this moment. It's not too much to say that the medium's survival as an industrial project hangs in the balance. And it's not just film. TV isn't in quite as desperate financial straits, but the threats to it come from the same place and could ultimately be just as deadly. I heard two of the most celebrated financial analysts the other week argue that the future belongs to the short, small and cheap; that big time production just is not where the world is right now.

I've been getting some really interesting listener comments and questions since the launch of Central Air - a lot of them about issues I've written on extensively in Very Serious - so let's reopen the Mayonnaise Clinic. By the way, you can always email your questions ( on virtually any topic ) to mayo@joshbarro.com. ChatGPT image generation First, though my distaste for Gavin Newsom is well known, I admitted on this week's episode that I am increasingly resigned to the prospect that Newsom will be the 2028 Democratic nominee. Brian sent in this response: This podcast should have a pillar that it will do everything it can to spoil a Newsom nomination. I say this as a Californian. He cannot be the nominee. We will lose by a million. It has to be a Shapiro or Whitmer type. Look, Newsom continues to be far from my first choice. I don't think he would put our party's best foot forward to swing voters. I want Josh Shapiro to be the nominee, and I also think Gretchen Whitmer would be a strong choice. Pete Buttigieg might be fine, too, though I continue to worry about his lack of an electoral track record beyond South Bend. But when I look back at my screed about Newsom from 2022 , I mostly cringe about having scolded him for flirting with a 2024 presidential run at a time when Joe Biden was on a course to run again. Oops! Gavin Newsom was on to something, and I didn't give him the credit he deserved! So maybe I should consider whether I also owe him credit in other areas. As I said on the show this week, Democratic voters are hungry for the party to \"fight back\" against Trump, which is awkward, because Democrats are in the minority in Congress and have few good tools to fight back. Newsom, to his credit, found a good tool: He is leading a likely successful effort to redraw California's congressional district maps and offset the effects of the redistricting the president demanded in Texas.

    "text": "The Leadership Shift No One Explains to New EMs What \"being technical\" means when you're no longer the one writing the code When new Engineering Managers look up at Directors, VPs, and CTOs, they often feel a quiet contradiction. On one hand, they're told: \"As you grow, you need to think more systemically.\" On the other, the industry celebrates: \"Very senior leaders who are still deeply technical.\" If you're a new EM, this creates an uncomfortable question: Should I stay close to the code to remain credible? Or step back and risk becoming vague, generic, or irrelevant? This post is an attempt to resolve that tension. It's based on patterns I've seen in mid-to-large engineering organisations. It is not universal truth. And it absolutely breaks down in some contexts, which I'll name explicitly. First, a clarification This is not an argument that senior leaders shouldn't be technical. And it is not a defence of managers who hide behind words like \"strategy\" or \"systems\" to excuse technical decay. Those people exist. They are harmful. And they're not what this article is describing. What is real - and often misunderstood - is that the nature of technical work changes as scope increases . If that distinction isn't clear, the rest of this doesn't land. Scope: when this applies - and when it doesn't This framing generally applies when: You're in a mid-size or large org (roughly 40+ engineers) There are Staff+ engineers owning deep technical decisions The work involves coordination, trade-offs, and long-term constraints It breaks down when: You're in a 10&#8211;20 person startup Leaders must code to keep the company alive There is no meaningful separation between execution and system design If you're early-stage: keep coding. A lot of this won't help you yet. The most common misread: \"Directors are just scaled EMs\" Many new Engineering Managers assume Directors are basically: EMs with more people, more meetings, and less time. If that's your model, you prepare in predictable ways: You stay close to delivery \"to be safe\" You personally unblock, decide, and smooth things You take on ambiguity so o",

    "text": "Turn Your Lit Mag Rejections into ‘Wins’ This Year How Reneé Bibby’s “Rejection Competition” Takes Away the Sting For every writer sending out their work to literary magazines, there is one inevitable truth: you will be rejected. A lot. And amidst the many rejections that you're going to receive, it's important that you remember two things: Rejection happens to EVERY writer (even the famous/successful ones, even the ones with multiple books). Rejections are NOT a reflection of the worth of your work or you as a writer or a person. However, even for experienced writers who know rejection is just part of the game, lit mag rejections can still be disheartening. That's why writer Rene&#233; Bibby created the annual Rejection Competition (now in its ninth year!) to help reframe rejections as \"wins\" and make writers feel less alone. Inspired by Kim Liao's Lit Hub article, \" Why You Should Aim for 100 Rejections a Year ,\" Rejection Competition is a friendly contest open to writers of all levels, genres, and ages from all over the world to see who can acquire the most lit mag rejections in a calendar year. \"The Lit Hub article really articulated this idea that you can only get acceptances if you're putting your work into the world, which means creating a relationship around rejections and understanding what rejections mean,\" said Rene&#233;. \"So, when I realized how intentional I would have to be about rejections, I figured, why do it alone? At my core, I'm basically like a border collie, and I really love to run around people, circle them up, and be like, &#8216;Guys, let's all be together. Let's all share our pain. Let's all share our joys, and sort of get that energy together.'\" Rejection Competition first began in 2017 with a small group of writers in Tucson, Arizona. It culminated in a year-end, in-person celebration to hand off a ridiculously oversized trophy called \"The Wings of Triumph\" to the winner. The competition has since grown to 75 writers and 7 divisions in 2025 and includes participants as far away as Australia and Thailand (the trophy has since been retired). \"Rene&#2",

For the last few days the tech world has been gossiping about the saga of his departure from Meta, in which every aspect of his character, negative and positive, from his arrogance and certitude to his commitment to science, has been on full display. You can get a glimpse of this in the excerpt from his interview with the FT , above. A long tweet below sums up some of the back story, mostly taking LeCun's side. The funny thing is that &#8211; with a huge technical asterisk discussed below - I, a longstanding critic of LeCun, am basically on LeCun's side in the fracas. More power to LeCun for standing his ground. Zuckerberg doesn't know more about AI than LeCun does, and Wang doesn't either. Furthermore, what LeCun does best is research. He may not be as original as he pretends to be , but he (mostly) has good intellectual taste, and someone like Wang, known mainly for a somewhat \"sordid\" data collection company rather than any particular technical vision has no business telling LeCun what to think. And it goes without saying that I too have huge doubts about LLMs. At this point so do literally hundreds of other researchers , even prominent machine learning insiders like Sutskever and Sutton. By sidelining LeCun, Zuck and Wang made it impossible for LeCun to stay. LeCun was right to depart, and justified as an accomplished scientist to want to pursue his own vision. And, also to the good, LeCun is very interested in world models, which is something I too have often stressed (sometimes under the term cognitive models) for many years, especially in my 2020 article The Next Decade in AI . So I'm glad that LeCun's new company will investigating a new approach. That said, I doubt that it will succeed, for two reasons. &#167; The first reason is technical.

That included giving a presidential address at the annual meeting. This took place after the election, but before Trump took office. This post summarized the speech, which outlined the looming threat of Trumpism.

But, most importantly, I needed some time to research where Garbage Day could move to if this truly was the breaking point for my relationship with Substack.

And between the litany of coupons I gave out early on and the new third price tier I introduced for Garbage Intelligence last year, moving has become somewhat daunting. But after the last few weeks, I can't stay here anymore. Substack has always had moderation issues, like every big platform. But, unlike every big platform, the company has a habit of turning these, frankly, fairly basic trust and safety problems into weird political fights that drag on for weeks. They did it in 2021 when trans writers were getting doxxed and harassed - by newsletters that are still very much publishing and monetizing on their platform - and they did it again last month after The Atlantic reported that neo-Nazis were publishing on the site. They were in my comment sections , as well. Right before Christmas, Substack co-founder Hamish McKenzie published a truly boneheaded post responding to the Nazi controversy, which contains what is may be the single worst paragraph ever written by a tech founder: I just want to make it clear that we don't like Nazis either-we wish no-one held those views. But some people do hold those and other extreme views. Given that, we don't think that censorship (including through demonetizing publications) makes the problem go away-in fact, it makes it worse. My man, you're not supposed to acknowledge actual Nazis are using your product. Even Elon Musk doesn't do that. Following McKenzie's post, I spoke with a lot of other writers on Substack, as well as folks at Substack directly. I agreed to keep my conversations with Substack off the",

Those on the right are, whether they admit it or not, aligning themselves with an increasingly authoritarian model of governance under Trump. Even before Trump's second term began, many progressive thinkers were forming their own criticisms of public institutions as too tied down by procedural constraints to actually realize their goals. I don't know which vision will win, or what the future of American governance will look like, but the safest bet is that it will look significantly different from the past. This December, I will match any new paid subscriptions to Can We Still Govern? with an equivalent gift to Give Directly , so consider subscribing! The combination of Trumpist authoritarianism and the many flavors of abundance sit uncomfortably together. A reasonable claim is that in the spaces where progressives still hold institutional power, they need to use it better, as well as plan for how to use federal power when they regain it. An unreasonable claim is that Trump is teaching Democrats how to govern. An example of this claim came from a recent essay by Marc Dunkelman in the New York Times, What the Left Could Learn From Trump's Brutal Efficiency . Dunkelman has worked in Democratic administrations and wrote the widely praised Why Nothing Works: Who Killed Progress and How to Bring it Back. The essay therefore does not come from a Trump defender, but reveals what I think is a temptation, even among his opponents, to treat Trumpism as a model for the future. This mistakes action for achievement, dismantling for building, and corruption for progress. To be fair to Dunkelman, I am going to quote him directly and extensively. I do so not to dunk on Dunkeman, but because I think it is an argument that deserves a response.

At Pinduoduo's shareholders' meeting in December 2025, Co-Chairman Zhao Jiazhen announced that in the next three years, they will &#8216;recreate a Pinduoduo' by &#8216;heavily investing in China's supply chain'. This claim was ambiguous, but it actually tells us a lot about where Temu will go next. Three phases of Temu Having studied Temu since the launch in September 2022, I see three clear phases ij Temu's development: Phase 1: C2M + Fully Managed Model Temu combined C2M (see below) with &#8216;fully managed services'; manufacturers only had to ship to Temu warehouses in Guangdong province, and Temu would take care of pricing, marketing and logistics, which was very attractive for factories that did not have the required skills and knowledge for cross-border commerce. Factories are relieved of the heavy burden of overseas operations, logistics, and after-sales service, allowing them to focus on their core competency: production. This fundamentally simplified the cross-border supply chain and significantly improved efficiency. Meanwhile, low prices and high discounts enabled Temu to &#8216;buy' market share. I reported on this phase in various Tech Buzz China reports between September 2022 and May 2024. I also explained this phase in a keynote at the K5 Future Retail conference in June 2024 (click to watch). Phase 2: Local warehouses Next, Temu shifted to local warehouses under the semi-managed model, forward warehouses under the fully managed model, and local-to-local business. This would reduce logistical costs for Temu and avoid high import tariffs, as several countries abolish import tax exemptions for direct-to-consumer packages. It also enabled Temu to deliver more quickly and to add more bulky items to its assortment. I have reported on this phase for Tech Buzz China from May 2024 to the present. I also described the development in the first section of a keynote at the K",

Consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. The intent seemed to be to create an iconic image reminiscent of the White House Situation Room during the raid that killed Osama bin Laden-a gathering of stoic men (no girls allowed!) staring grimly at some unseen screen. The message: \"Look how serious and important our work is!\" Yet, the staged nature of these photos undermines that effect, leaving the whole scene feeling less like history in the making and more like an amateur theater production of a Broadway classic. In one image, the Director of the CIA, the Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Secretary of Defense are grouped around a laptop. Behind them, unmistakably, a screen displays a feed from X-complete with a prominent yellow emoji. In other pictures, \"Venezuela\" appears to be in the search box. With the best intelligence systems in the world at their fingertips, they were checking X in the midst of the mission? Combined with the curtains separating some section of Mar&#8209;A&#8209;Lago from the rest of the President's resort, the images create an almost surreal air.

    "text": "Solo Card Games and Decision Making The underlying complexity of cards and how to use them to create dynamic decisions for players. The Two Basic Levers of a Combat-based Solo Card Game If you're playing a game where you build a deck of cards and do combat, the two levers that are pulled are your ability to deal damage and your ability to mitigate damage dealt to you. Status effects or cards that augment the amount of cards used are variations of that concept (making an enemy deal less damage = damage mitigation/making yourself deal more damage = increasing ability to deal damage/increasing the number of cards you can play = greater degree of choices in mitigating damage or dealing damage). The Two Levers of any Card Game. The interesting complexities of a card game, I'd argue, comes from what decisions are made outside of the card playing. Scenario One - A Card Game with Limited Complexity You have one opponent and this opponent has 5 Health. The opponent is hitting you for 5 Health worth of damage. You draw 5 Cards. You can play any 3 of the 5 Cards. 2 of these cards deal 1 point of damage. 2 other cards deal 2 points of damage. The final card will Block 5 points of damage. If you can only play 3 Cards, your decision is streamlined into the most obvious and efficient course of action: you play two cards that deal 2 points of damage each and one card that deals 1 point of damage to defeat your opponent. This is a card game at its most basic. A game like this, where your cards are variations of dealing and blocking damage and the chance of succeeding or failing on a given turn is based on the luck of the draw does not lead to any compelling decisions or complex strategy. Even introducing a mechanic like a \"mulligan\" where you can discard your cards and draw an equal number of cards does little to add to the complexity of the game. You play the cards you're dealt and with a mulligan, you're fishing for the most optimal set of cards in your deck. When your only levers are dealing damage or mitigating damage, the choice for the player is an illusion. A simple way to expand a players decision making",

The following is a (modified) excerpt that I've decided to spin off into its own piece. Expect the full essay within a month or so. 1. Introduction If you have been following A.I. research and development over the last couple of years, you likely will have encountered one or both of the figures below. They come from non-profit A.I. research institute METR's \"Measuring AI Ability to Complete Long Tasks\" benchmark, which has come to be seen as a critical bellwether of A.I. capability growth. The Long Tasks benchmark measures trends in A.I. models' abilities to complete software engineering tasks by comparison to how long those tasks take humans. The AI Futures Project (the team responsible for AI 2027 ) recently called METR's Long Tasks benchmark \"the best benchmark currently available for extrapolating to very capable AIs.\" In his 2025 letter , Google DeepMind Engineer Zhengdong Wang describes METR's benchmark as \"many people's first introduction to the case that AI will be a big deal.\" Screenshots of what is often simply called the \"the METR graph\" have been posted and reposted to death on X by a veritable army of A.I. researchers, engineers, and businesspeople. The subtext (or often simply the text) of these posts is that A.I. models are improving so rapidly that they may soon displace a large proportion of human knowledge-workers, not to mention pose a wide variety of serious, even existential risks to our wellbeing. Alternatively, they could usher in a utopia of economy-wide automation, freeing humans from the yoke of necessary labor, and bringing about a world of once-unimaginable material abundance. While I am skeptical of these extreme scenarios, my goal here is not to convince you that they are overblown. Instead, it is to convince you that METR's Long Tasks benchmark does not even re",

Although vaccination is not possible at this age, vaccination of people in the environment who come into contact with them provides some protection, and therefore it is important to vaccinate the entire population. The Ministry emphasizes that although the flu vaccine does not completely prevent illness, it reduces the severity in most cases. The 1918 Influenza Pandemic: A short history and lessons learned The vaccine is available and provided free of charge by health insurance funds Due to the principle of preventive caution, the Ministry of Health recommends that at-risk populations consider wearing masks in closed places and in gatherings.

These next images you're about view stem from an age of former reclamation from an abject disregard, to then witness the steady and insightful recovery from a precipitous fall.

Foreign Interference and the Alberta Prosperity Project JASON FRANSON/THE CANADIAN PRESS When does a separatist movement become a threat to Canada's national security? Thanks for reading! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. This is a question hanging in the air in Alberta. People are asking how it can possibly be that the very same individuals who are leading the separatist movement can also be three meetings deep into a relationship with senior officials of the Trump Administration in Washington, with a fourth scheduled for this month. Treason. Sedition. Traitorous. These are words that are ricocheting around the radio talk shows, and the social media channels. In the aftermath of the US's move on Venezuela people are genuinely concerned that Canada could also be \"on the menu.\" There is a growing recognition that resource imperialism has become the basic orienting principle of US grand strategy. And that Canada, as a resource rich, and militarily poor nation has become exceptionally vulnerable to it. A sovereignty referendum engineered by a group known as the Alberta Prosperity Project at a time like this takes on exceptional, existential risk to Canada's continuance as a sovereign nation in the Western Hemisphere. It's important, therefore, to understand where the line between political movement and national security threat is drawn in Canada. It is, as we know, entirely legal in Canada to advocate and campaign in support of a province or territory leaving confederation. This is covered by the Clarity Act , but also by the Charter which protects the rights of citizens to free expression, assembly, and association. Any organic political movement that is based in a genuine desire to achieve an outcome of their design is free to pursue that through whatever lawful means available to them. Foreign interference in such movements however, is where the line between lawful advocacy and dissent crosses into territory that constitutes a threat to Canada's national security.

Terwijl de meeste ogen gericht zijn op chatbots en spectaculaire demo's van nieuwe AI-videomodellen, voltrekt zich elders een meer geruisloze, maar mogelijk beslissende ontwikkeling in de \"AI-oorlog\". De strijd om wie &#8216;de agent voor alles' gaat maken wordt misschien beslist in je mailbox. Google pusht z'n AI dit keer niet in een aparte app maar in een van de meest gebruikte digitale omgevingen ter wereld: Gmail, met 3 miljard accounts. Google maakte afgelopen week de introductie van Gemini-functionaliteiten bekend in het systeem dat in 2004 begon als een gratis emailserver met 1 gigabyte cloudopslag &#8211; wat we toen nog geen cloud noemden trouwens. Van inbox naar intelligent systeem Gmail wordt uitgebreid met een reeks Gemini-gedreven functies. Een van de meest opvallende toevoegingen is AI Overviews: gebruikers kunnen hun inbox doorzoeken alsof ze een chatbot a la Gemini (of ChatGPT) gebruiken. Geen eindeloze zoektermen meer of tientallen mails doorspitten, maar simpelweg vragen: \"Welke mails van vorige week vragen actie?\" en Gmail levert context, samenvatting en relevante berichten. Maar ook \"Wat was de naam van de loodgieter die ik vorig jaar februari heb gebeld?\" Google introduceert ook een soort persoonlijke assistent die automatisch de belangrijkste mails boven water haalt, takenlijstjes opstelt en herinneringen suggereert. De inbox verandert daarmee van een archief steeds meer in dashboard dat gestroomlijnd is met je cloud, agenda en andere functies van je Google-account. Ook aan de productiekant wordt Gmail slimmer.

In fact, I am writing this cautionary post because I am not a doomsdayer about AI, because I am not a Luddite about AI, and because I intend to become an intensive user of Claude Code for all practical work. I have an idiosyncratic approach that has become so second nature to me that I am consistently surprised when others see how I use it and then tell me they are surprised by how I use it - I mean not what I use it on, but rather how I use it . That fact has worried me because I have started to wonder - perhaps someone reading my posts, where I am blunt and honest that Claude Code is going to be absolutely transformative for quantitative social scientists unlike anything we've ever used once they see it with their own eyes. Once they see it with their own eyes, they will jump into it into ways I thought it was obvious not to do. But there are risks to using Claude Code. And those risks I suspect are in the variety of \"unknown knowns\" and \"unknown unknowns\". Some things the average users of Claude Code know and maybe will write about, but since they aren't social scientists, probably not enough. And some of it no one knows. But we can sort of guess at where those risks might be for us, the marginal user, the social scientists. It'll come down to something Claude Code did in one of our directories. And since there's a finite number of real problems that could happen inside a directory, I think some of these risks can be at least outlined, if not solved, without hopefully having to have an expensive failure make it so. So that in mind, I want to and need to write in a more circumspect way, not to warn people away from Claude Code, but because I'm positive that many when they finally get around to using it will never turn back. It will be for them like it has been for me - like finding the keys to a Corvette with some nitrous set",

In July 2024, I gave a talk on the science of contagion at the 65th International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) in Bath. The IMO is the leading mathematical competition for high school students. Each year, it brings together students from each country who've already passed a series of selection tests. As well as having the honour of speaking to some of the brightest young mathematicians from around the world, I also found it fun to include a lot more mathematical nuggets than I'd usually put in a public lecture. That particular IMO competition would end up being more significant than I'd realised. The following week, DeepMind announced that its AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry models had been able to solve four out of six problems that had been posed in the 2024 contest, equivalent to silver medal-level standard. It was the first time AI had managed to achieve this performance. The following year, DeepMind would do even better , with an advanced version of Gemini achieving gold-medal standard under IMO exam conditions. Here's one of the questions it managed to solve: \"A line in the plane is called sunny if it is not parallel to any of the x -axis, the y -axis, and the line x + y = 0. Let n &#10878; 3 be a given integer. Determine all nonnegative integers k such that there exist n distinct lines in the plane satisfying both of the following: for all positive integers a and b with a + b &#10877; n + 1 , the point (a, b) is on at least one of the lines; and exactly k of the n lines are sunny\" A Lean, keen, proving machine Last November, DeepMind published a paper in Nature that outlined how AlphaProof had achieved its high performance in the 2024 Olympiad. First, human experts had translated the non-geometry problems from natural language into a formal &#8203;mathematical representation using the Lean software language.

Not a one-year or two-year or even three-year pilot. Not a few hundred or few thousand participants. A policy spanning over two centuries, distributing everything from poverty-level incomes to amounts equivalent to $15,000 per month in modern purchasing power. And the results absolutely demolish the idea that giving people money makes most of them stop working for more money. This is the question that haunts every conversation about Universal Basic Income. It doesn't matter if we're discussing a UBI of $1,000 a year or $10,000 a month or anything in between-someone always asks: \"But won't people just quit their jobs?\" The Brazil data, analyzed in 2025 by Marcelo Ferreira at Princeton, doesn't just challenge the laziness myth. It drives a stake through its heart. And when we combine this historical evidence with the massive systematic reviews of the past decade and the just-released 2025 End of Year Report covering 27 American pilots, the picture becomes undeniable.

The solution was elegantly simple: a pension for unmarried daughters that would last for life. The logic was paternalistic but practical-women had limited economic opportunities in the 18th century, so the state would provide a floor for them to stand on. But something striking happened as the centuries rolled on. In Brazil, this policy expanded. According to Ferreira's research, the scope grew ",

A shame of modern America. How many Supreme Court seats were stolen, while Wall Street and corporate America looked the other way, to achieve this disgraceful end? Any corporation that has donated to the Republican Party and the Senators who voted to approve the Christian Fascists on the Supreme Court has to answer for this forthcoming decision. Corporations have power. It's its due time they pick a side. If they want a Christian Fascist nation, they should continue financially supporting the Republican Party. If they want a democracy, they should act like it. What the hucksters in Florida are doing with Disney the GOP will do to all corporations. If that's the business environment Wall Street wants, they should continue to play both sides. The wealthy may think all their money will be able to buy them freedom in the Christian Fascist nation, but they are only deluding themselves. Far too many in America gave into these Christian Fascists. Now, they have the power to rewrite American values for their deranged ends. If this opinion stands, the same reasoning could be used to overturn interracial and gay marriage, birth control, and countless other rights we now take for granted. This is the Christian Fascism we've been warned about for a generation. It's now here. More on Facebook: fb.com/TomPaineToday",

    "text": "Marshall McLuhan and the Political Systems We Forgot to Model On Systems and Democratic Strain Over the years, I've come to realize that my affection for Marshall McLuhan is not really about his media theory at all. It's about how he thought about systems. Thanks for reading Sacred Cow BBQ! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. You may have to forgive the love letter that is about to ensue, but I think about this guy's work more than I'd like to admit. Part of McLuhan's mystique (and, let's be honest, also part of why he's sometimes misunderstood) is his writing style. It is dense as hell, often aphoristic, and far more intent on opening questions than closing them. Critics (and plenty of readers) have described it as compelling yet occasionally bewildering, the kind of prose that rewards deep engagement but resists simple exposition. What makes McLuhan worth returning to now, in my opinion, is not nostalgia for mid-century media theory, but the fact that many of our current political failures look less like ideological disagreement (though there's definitely some of that, don't get me wrong!) and more like system-level mismatch. We keep diagnosing content problems in what is actually an environment problem-and that seems like something we really need to get right. McLuhan is usually remembered for some amazing, sticky aphorisms- \"the medium is the message,\" \"the global village,\" and so on, yeah that's him!-but what he actually offered were early theories of how communication systems restructure cognition, coordination, authority, and legitimacy at scale . Long before my field of political science had the language of complex systems, feedback loops, or nonlinear effects, McLuhan was already describing them, he just did it in prose instead of equations or causal diagrams. In an era of algorithmic governance, attention markets, and collapsing institutional trust, that turns out to be unusually useful to reflect on. Media as Systems, Not Channels Most political communication models, implicitly or explicitly, treat \"media\" as pipes . Messag",

The article by the chief of the CPC's International Liaison Department sheds light on the Party's view of systems and ideological competition with the West. Here are the key reports and articles from the People's Daily's edition on Thursday, January 08, 2026. Page 1: There's another Zhong Caiping commentary today; this one basically makes the case that China's economy has been strong and resilient through 2025, despite the challenges, and the credit goes to Xi Jinping's leadership. It says: \"The Chinese economy has always grown amidst the baptism of wind and rain, and strengthened through the endurance of trials. In 2025, under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, we have consistently responded to the uncertainties of the international environment with the certainty of high-quality development, unswervingly managed our own affairs well, and strengthened our internal capabilities to cope with external challenges, thereby promoting the effective qualitative improvement and reasonable quantitative growth of the Chinese economy. Facing a turbulent international environment, we have responded calmly and pressed forward despite the pressure. Since the beginning of last year, the US has successively used the so-called &#8216;fentanyl issue' and &#8216;reciprocal tariffs' as excuses to impose multiple rounds of tariff suppression against us, with the added tariff rates reaching 145% at one point. Under the unified deployment of the Party Central Committee, we persisted in a &#8216;two-pronged approach'. &#20013;&#22269;&#32463;&#27982;&#65292;&#20174;&#26469;&#37117;&#26159;&#22312;&#39118;&#38632;&#27927;&#31036;&#20013;&#25104;&#38271;&#65292;&#22312;&#21382;&#32463;&#32771;&#39564;&#20013;&#22766;&#22823;&#12290;2025&#24180;&#65292;&#22312;&#20197;&#20064;&#36817;&#24179;&#21516;&#24535;&#20026;&#26680;&#24515;&#30340;&#20826;&#20013;&#22830;&#22362;&#24378;&#39046;&#23548;&#19979;&#65292;&#25105;&#20204;&#22987;&#32456;&#20197;&#39640;&#36136;&#37327;&#21457;&#23637;&#30340;&#30830;&#23450;&#24615;&#24212;&#23545;&#22269;&#38469;&#29615;&#22659;&#30340;&#19981;&#30830;&#234",

I was in a bit of a rut, and decided to see if I could write my way out of it. The plan ever since has been to write something every week, and just see where that takes me. This will be my 43rd and final post of the year. I took a few breaks to work on the book manuscript . Readership growth has tailed off a bit - I started the year around 9,000 subscribers, and will end just north of 11,000. Conceptually, I've noticed that my writing here has gotten shorter and more take-shaped. In 2022 and 2023, I was mostly using this venue to work through some big ideas that were destined for the book. I would spend several days per week trying to wrestle those ideas into shape, and the essays were usually in the 2,500-3,500 word range. This year, while I refined those earlier ideas into book-shaped form, my blogging was more focused on immediate reactions to political or tech news. They tended to fall in the 1,000-1,500 word range, written in a single writing session. That's&#8230; fine . But I'd like to get back to taking bigger swings in 2026. Professionally, next year is going to be an odd one for me. The book will be in production all year, slated for an early 2027 release. I'll be occupying that awkward liminal space where the work is done, and all that's left is the waiting. This has been my main intellectual project since the summer of 2018. I'm going to need to find some interesting ways to distract myself. I don't quite know what shape those distractions will take. I have a few ideas. Stay tuned&#8230; it could get pretty fun.

The bottom line? AI is invading 3D space. It's coming to our world soon, looking more and more like C-3PO. And the timeline is accelerating faster than anyone anticipated.

Its orange logo said: \"House of Journalists.\" The man said, \"I'm a journalist. I should have a &#8216;House of Journalists' shirt.\" He asked how he could get one. And I said that he couldn't get one, because he's not a part of the House of Journalists. Then the inquisitive reporter, who works for a British TV news channel, asked, \"What is the House of Journalists ?\" It's a collection of two dozen journalists from Germany, Canada, France and the U.S. who cover the automotive industry, trucking, technology, business and consumer trends. In another life, many of these people are direct competitors. Not anymore. Working in an industry under siege, these journalists are allies. Their work appears in newspapers, magazines, on websites, TV, radio and podcasts. Some are employed by media companies while many are freelance.

Groups of investors huddle in corners and around tables in public spaces, debating the science or technology or potential for profit.

On MS NOW today, columnist Philip Bump broke down when talking about the shooting of Renee Nicole Good yesterday in Minneapolis. \"I have a six year old,\" he said. \"And&#8230;seeing the image of the stuffed animals in the glove compartment of her car-really emotional for me and&#8230;what I take away from this is, for me that's the thing that stands out: that this was a family that could have been like mine.\" Bump went on to emphasize that \"there are a lot of situations, a lot of incidents that have involved ICE, have involved the government over the course of the past thirteen months in which there is resonance for other families in similar ways,\" but what he hit on in his first reaction to Good's killing was the one the administration must fear most of all. Good was a white, suburban mother, whose ex-husband told reporters she was a Christian stay-at-home mom, and Bump is a white man. President Donald J. Trump's people see that demographic as their base. If it turns on Trump, they are politically finished, as finished as elite southern enslavers were when Harriet Beecher Stowe reminded American mothers of the fragility of their own childrens' lives to condemn the sale of Black children; as finished as the second Ku Klux Klan was when its leader kidnapped, raped, and murdered 28-year-old Madge Oberholtzer; as finished as the white segregationists were when white supremacists murdered four little girls in church in 1963. Evidence that President Donald J. Trump has sexually abused children would likely be enough to crater his political support from this group, making it no accident that the administration is openly flouting the law that required the full release of the Epstein Files by December 19, 2025.

    "text": "✨ Don’t expect an AI job apocalypse Goldman Sachs sees meaningful AI-driven displacement, but little evidence that technology will permanently sideline human workers. It's analysis worth paying attention to My fellow pro-growth/progress/abundance Up Wingers in the USA and around the world: Fears that technology will render human labor obsolete are nearly as old as industrial machinery itself. Of course, artificial intelligence has given these anxieties loads of fresh momentum. Will human workers yet go the way of the horse? 1 Goldman Sachs takes that concern seriously - and then largely rejects it. In an illuminating new analysis , \"How Concerned Should We Be About a Job Apocalypse?\", the bank's economists reiterate their estimate that AI could eventually automate tasks accounting for roughly a quarter of all work hours in the US economy. That exposure is large enough to justify unease. It isn't, however, the same thing as total job destruction of the sort AI doomers often warn. Translating exposure into employment outcomes, Goldman's baseline forecast implies that about 6&#8211;7 percent of jobs are displaced over the full AI adoption period. Again, that's meaningful disruption, sure, but hardly mass extinction. 2 GS: \"We remain skeptical that unemployment rate increases will be permanent as long as human labor maintains a competitive advantage in certain aspects of production.\" 3 Subscribe now Here's how GS newly quantifies the labor-market impact: Under its central scenario - AI adoption spread over roughly a decade - the unemployment rate rises by a little over half a percentage point at the peak, equivalent to about one million additional unemployed workers. If adoption is faster or AI proves more labor-displacing than past technologies, the hit could double to roughly 1.2 percentage points. Only in a combined downside case does Goldman see the peak impact rising to around 2.4 percentage points, or roughly four million workers - and even then, the joblessness is transitional rather than permanent. The rise reflects the time it takes for displaced workers to retrain, relocate, and rematch - not a lasting surplus of idle labor. As productivity gains spread and new r",

She was diagnosed with lupus during college, and the disease quickly became a relentless adversary. The usual first-line medication, steroids, that dampen the immune response and often bring relief, barely made a dent. Her lupus was refractory, stubbornly resisting every standard approach. Eventually, her doctors turned to an advanced therapy - a type of immunotherapy that depleted her B cells, the immune cells that play a central role in lupus. At the time, its use was off-label and an unconventional last-ditch measure, but it worked. Slowly, her symptoms eased, and she regained control of her life. What amazes me most is not just the science behind her recovery, but her resilience. Despite years of debilitating illness, she persevered, graduated, and went on to earn her PharmD. She is brilliant, kind, and cheerful - a living testament to the power of perseverance and modern medicine, particularly immunotherapy or treatments that harness the body's own immune system to fight disease. Her story is just one example of how complex lupus can be and why understanding this disease - from the molecular, cellular, and immunological level - matters. So, what exactly is lupus , and why does it sometimes require such aggressive treatments? Let's discuss&#8230; What Is Lupus? Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) , commonly known as lupus, is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects millions worldwide. For patients with lupus , the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissues. This can lead to inflammation and damage in multiple organs, including the skin (most notably a distinctive rash across the face), joints, kidneys, reproductive system, intestines, lungs, and even the heart. Even the name hints at its bite: lupus is Latin for wolf, named centuries ago for the facial rashes that physicians thought resembled wolf bites. SLE is the most common and severe form ",

    "text": "14 predictions about 2024 AI! Elections! Threads! Media! And more \"The numerals 2024 set against a futuristic, utopian cityscape\" / DALL-E A year ago, as I sat down to write my predictions for 2023, two things seemed unusually clear. One was that Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter was disrupting the old order in social networking far faster and more dramatically than even his biggest detractors had predicted. The other is that the launch of ChatGPT just a few weeks earlier had set in motion a much more significant shift - though the scope of that shift would turn out to be much wider than I guessed at the time. Twelve months later, we're living in a changed world. Musk killed off the Twitter brand, along with at least half of its revenues, and drove more than 100 million people onto a rival platform built by Meta. And while the shifting fortunes of our biggest social networks continue to play a critical role in shaping politics, culture, and society, the speed with which generative artificial intelligence systems are improving now seem likely to prove even more significant. Over the next year, I expect to see both trends accelerating: on one hand, a once-in-a-generation realignment in text-based social networking that will further entrench Meta as the biggest player in the space; and on the other, the proliferation of generative AI into every digital surface that we touch, and much of the infrastructure that powers it. The trends will have their highest-profile collision to date in the run-up to the 2024 US presidential election, where platform policies and enforcement mechanisms could once again prove hugely consequential - for American democracy, and for the platforms themselves. Just thinking about it all is enough to make me want to go lie down for a couple weeks - which, upon sending out today's newsletter, is exactly what I intend to do. Before that, though, I have a few more thoughts on what we can expect in 2024, and Zo&#235; has some to share as well. In the meantime, thanks for supporting Platformer through a momentous year",

(Meta) Today, for a change of pace, let's talk about something other than the fate of Substack and all those who dwell upon it. Instead, let's look at the mounting pressure on social networks to make their apps safer for young people, and the degree to which both platforms and regulators continue to talk past one another. Let's start with the news. Today, Meta said it would take additional steps to prevent users under the age of 18 from seeing content involving self-harm, graphic violence and eating disorders, among other harms. Here's Julie Jargon at the Wall Street Journal : Teen accounts - that is, accounts of under-18 users, based on the birth date entered during sign-up - will automatically be placed into the most restrictive content settings. Teens under 16 won't be shown sexually explicit content. On Instagram, this is called Sensitive Content Control, while on Facebook, it is known as Reduce. Previously, teens could choose less stringent settings. Teen users can't opt out of these new settings. The new restricted status of teen accounts means teens won't be able to see or search for harmful content, even if it is shared by a friend or someone they follow. For example, if a teen's friend had been posting about dieting, those posts will no longer be visible to the teen. However, teens might still see content related to a friend's recovery from an eating disorder. The changes announced today fall broadly into a category of platform tweaks that could be labeled \"They weren't doing that already?\" But the fact that Meta made these changes, which the Journal calls \"the biggest change the tech giant has made to ensure younger users have a more age-appropriate experience on its social-media sites,\" underscores the degree to which child safety has become the most important dimension along which social networks are being judged in 2024. How did that become the case? The most consequential shift in attempts to ",

Fortunately for the Allies and the world, only 48 were built. The main reason was its dependence on a German engine, and the prioritising of easier-to-build domestic aircraft by the dominant Axis nation. This final volume in his trilogy on the wartime Italian fighters, aviation historian Luigino Caliaro tells the fascinating story of Reggiane's aircraft, the RE.2000, RE. 2001, RE. 2002, RE. 2003, and the brilliant RE. 2005. The Projects Unrealised chapter includes some enjoyably weird ideas, such as a twin-fuselage version (the same concept as the Twin Mustang) made of wood, and a &#8216;turbo-compound' model with two engines feeding twin compressors, a combustion chamber, and exhaust nozzles. This is a fascinating, dense work with many interesting images, documents and ephemera of the time. With relatively little in English on the Reggiane series, this is a welcome book on an extremely interesting subject. Reading this, it's hard not to think about the bigger picture. The brilliant Reggiane engineers who served Mussolini's hideous state as a stark historical moral. Officine Meccaniche Reggiane operated as a willing part of Mussolini's fascist war economy, producing military aircraft for a horrific dictatorship.

I have a real bee in my bonnet about this&#8230; Before Christmas, the newspapers were publishing a *lot* of articles about the resident doctor strikes. The articles were overwhelmingly negative, many essentially accusing the doctors of putting NHS patients at risk. These articles didn't pay proper attention to the way that doctor strikes are covered in the NHS, and the fact that senior doctors would step in to cover the work in order to keep patients safe. The situation became so heated that I actually received emails about this to my personal email address, because a lot of people were understandably extremely worried by what they were reading in the papers. And now, something else has happened&#8230; There has been a slew of recent articles, highlighting how well the NHS coped throughout the strikes. It's been covered in The Times, The Telegraph and The Independent, with The Times leading with this headline: \"&#8216;Remarkable' NHS keeps 95% of appointments during doctors' strikes\". Now, I'm not trying to put the NHS down - it's brilliant that this level of activity continued during the strike days - but I do have an issue with anyone trying to present the idea that this was unexpected. When the resident doctor strikes happened in November, the NHS managed to continue more than 95% of the planned elective activity going then too! Here's what NHS England said about it at the time: \"The NHS managed to &#8216;safely keep the show on the road' despite industrial action last week, with data showing more than 95% of planned elective activity going ahead for patients.\" I don't blame anyone for worrying about the NHS right now- it's in a terrible state. But it's extremely frustrating to see how politicised the reporting about these resident doctor strikes has become. The hospitals were never going to be left unattended during strikes - the senior doctors were always going to step in and step up to cover shifts where necessary.

Here is a quandary I find myself in: anal stimulation gives me intense, sometimes even overwhelming pleasure, and yet I rarely make the journey inside my sphincter unless there is someone else's enjoyment involved. It's like if your house was equipped to display a beautiful, brilliant light show, but in order to trigger it, you had to climb a rickety ladder into your attic and move a bunch of boxes and get high, high up on your tippy toes in order to reach the switch. So you figure, why go to all that trouble just for me? Best to save it for when company's coming. That's not quite right, but it will do for now. This is a quandary that has bedeviled me for years. Historically, it's been entwined with the desires - or, rather, lack thereof - of my partners. Somebody moves into your house and the light show doesn't quite do it for them, so you figure, \"Hey, whatever, we have tea and scones that we both enjoy, surely that is good enough.\" And maybe every so often you try to convince them that the light show really is something they enjoy, but that discussion takes so much effort that by the time you turn the lights on, they seem dimmer, less exciting than you remembered. Or you invite someone into your home and in their eagerness to explore your home they knock over a few vases and you start to worry that in their rush to enjoy the light show they might break the rickety ladder and bust up all the boxes and maybe even blow the fuse - and you just can't risk that kind of damage, so you just tell them that your house doesn't have a light show, you know? Okay, I think this metaphor has been stretched far enough. Anyway. Like I said, it's a quandary, and it's one that I've been living with for quite some time - actually, fuck, nearly two decades. And for most of that time it just seemed like how things were: you might love throwing fancy dinner parties, but if nobody in your social circle wants to attend one, you're not going to bust out the fancy napkins just ",

Re civ decline, my basic story is that a key contribution to the fall of civilizations is plausibly that as a civ gets big, rich, and peaceful, its local cultural evolution process parameters get worse, at least at the culture level. There is typically lower variety, weaker selection pressures, and faster environmental change. So the process goes bad, its cultures drift into maladaption, and the civ falls. Our current civ will plausibly suffer this fate, with the added problem that due to modern cultural activism we also have higher rates of internal cultural drift. What does this say about Christianity? Early on it was a small sect competing with many others, and the fact that it won against them suggests that it was unusually adaptive then, at least in that context. Then it took over the Roman Empire and most of Europe, and became securely in pace for millennia. And while securely in place, Christianity substantially changed its character many times. So doesn't my theory suggest that those changes would on average have been maladaptive? Well first notice that most Europeans didn't know much about Christian doctrine re how to live ordinary peasant lives until about 1600 or so. Before then Christianity mainly influenced elites, cities, and larger institutions. Also, there was often lots of competition within Christianity; the cultural evolution problem would only be re cultural features that were imposed on everyone in Christianity, allowing little local deviation. Okay, but Christianity influenced marriage much earlier, from about 1200, promoting monogamy and banning cousins marriage, and that suppressed family clans. Christianity also pushed individualism early on, via consent in marriage and the freedom to write wills, especially donations to the Church. And those wills funded many big monasteries, which slowly took over lots of European land. Also, conflicts between the church and crowns started early and weakly contributed to the lack of a single power taking o",

    "text": "It was not a super flu year Update on flu and covid in England In early December the government and the NHS were issuing dire warnings about super flu , an unprecedented flu wave , and the NHS facing its worst winter since the heights of Covid. Along with many other people watching the data, I couldn't see where these warnings were coming from. Yes, flu season had started early but there was nothing to say - at that time - that it would be worse than previous years. I wrote about it in a December substack post and spoke about it on Sky News . I was worried that this was a bad use of data to scare the public - and striking doctors - into specific actions. A month later, and it's clear that this was not a worse flu year than previous years. Flu admissions peaked in mid December. While the most recent hopsital admission data (to 29 December) shows a small increase in hospitalisations 1 , we are nowhere near 2022 or 2024's peaks, or (so far) overall numbers, even if we get a double peak like we had in 2023/24. Meanwhile, RSV admissions steady but relatively high, and Covid admissions are low and steady. If the government and NHS messaging was about trying to change the public's behaviour (and behaviour might have changed), then I don't think the approach is justified. Getting the public to get to a behaviour through misleading presentation of data from the people and organisations who are meant to be trusted experts is counterproductive and wrong. It's also lazy when you should make the effort to improve the situation through well-established public health measures. This includes improving physical infrastructure such as better ventilation (particularly in health care, school and crowded indoor settings), improving provision (better resourced GPs and hospitals), and better public messaging (e.g. emphasising ventilation and mask wearing alongside hand washing and surface cleaning, or staying home when sick). If the government and NHS messaging was about pressuring the doctors to call off the strike, then I find that cynical and unet",

However you felt about 2025, I hope 2026 is better. I owe you all some stuff, including the answers to your Ask Me Anything questions. You'll have that soon. Part of the delay stems from the fact that I have a book deadline early next week and I've been crashing a bit. (For anyone who is new to this Substack, the book is about the debate over youth gender medicine in the United States.) I've been meaning to experiment, in a more structured way, with the Substack Live feature. I also need breaks because I can only do so many hours of work in a row. So: Tomorrow at 4:55 PM Eastern, I'll send out a Substack Live link to premium Singal-Minded subscribers and do a 45-minute or so video talk/Q&A about my book. Unless I'm missing something, there's no way to pre-schedule this sort of event without an iPhone, so I'll just send out the link five minutes beforehand. If you're a premium subscriber, you'll get it then and will be just one click from joining the event. I'll start the Hangout with a 10-ish-minute prepared mini-talk/update about the book, and then I'll answer your questions. If you have any questions about my work on youth gender medicine, post them here. I'll favor the most upvoted comments, and I'll also react, in real time, to whatever pops up in the chat. Forty-five minutes is an estimate, and the length will depend a bit on how many questions I get. Subscribe now If you can't make it, no worries - the video will be available for premium subscribers afterward. On a separate note, there are going to be some changes to Singal-Minded this year that I'm excited about, and which I'll be announcing late this month or early in February. But in the meantime, I hope to see a bunch of you tomorrow at 5:00, and I really appreciate your support.

The past year brought the largest measles outbreak in decades and a tidal wave of false information on vaccines, including from the highest levels of government. Just days into 2026, HHS overhauled the recommended childhood vaccine schedule -not because of new science, but because of politics. To put it simply, we've been through a health gauntlet.

    "text": "The Law Is “Fake and Gay” Turns out the Trump domination theory of foreign policy applies to domestic politics, too. Before we start: A brief word about Jerome Powell. On the livestream last night I said that I did not expect markets to panic today about the consequences of Fed independence. As I'm writing, it's business as usual on Wall Street. No panic. Not even a lot of tangible disapproval. Why is that? I have a theory. Donald Trump is a real estate guy. All real estate guys want low interest rates. If you deal in real estate, low interest rates are good for your business no matter what else is happening. Ergo, Trump believes that interest rates should always be low. 1 You know who else loves low interest rates? Big Tech. For tech giants, access to capital is the most important thing and cheap money is what allows companies like Facebook, Google, OpenAI, Uber, and MoviePass to grow. When interest rates are high, speculative bets-like tech companies, which propose that scale matters more than cash flow-are much harder to sustain. Currently, the stock market is being propped up by Big Tech. The Magnificent Seven constitute 34 percent of the S&P 500's value . That proportion is a very large historical outlier. My theory is that a market beholden to Big Tech stocks is not going to be concerned about the political independence of the Fed if the result is return to ZIRP . Cheap capital is more important to them than the health of the bond market. This is part of my larger thesis about Wall Street's bizarre reaction to Trump, in which the stock market on the whole has performed way in excess of what the various economic indicators would suggest. If you want to drink in my economic nihilism, go back and read \" Wall Street Loves Trump Because LOL Nothing Matters \" from eleven months ago. Fair warning: This stuff will turn you into the Joker.

Screens showed images, but they didn't do anything with them. Epson's solution was not software, networking, or sharing. It was a printer bolted to the bottom of a television. That machine was the Livingstation LS47P2. The idea was blunt and literal: insert a memory card, browse photos on a 47-inch screen, freeze a frame, and print. Epson was trying to turn the living room into a kiosk, driven less by consumer demand than by its own worldview. At the time, televisions were already in flux. CRTs still dominated and delivered excellent image quality. Rear-projection sets existed to serve people who wanted size at the cost of bulk and compromise. Flat panels were expensive, imperfect, and improving faster than anyone expected. Epson was not a television company, but it was a printer company. Rather than ask how people actually used televisions, Epson treated the TV as a trojan horse for what it really sold: ink, paper, and output. On paper, the LS47P2 looked competitive. It used a 3-LCD projection system with three 0.7-inch polysilicon panels and a 100-watt lamp rated for up to 10,000 hours. Native resolution was 720p, which was not forward-looking for a $3,000 television in the mid-2000s. It was the minimum acceptable definition of \"HD.\" Connectivity was extensive, including DVI-HDTV, component, composite, S-Video, RF tuners, and AV outputs. Epson even highlighted the set's depth, just under fifteen inches, as if that were an achievement. It wasn't. Fifteen inches was still fat at a moment when flat panels were already flirting with single-digit thickness. The battle had moved on, and Epson was measuring the wrong front. The printer was the real point of the product. Epson called the concept \"Photo on Demand,\" a phrase that made sense only if you believed people wanted to operate office equipment from their couch. The LS47P2 supported SD, Memory Stick, CompactFlash, ",

Plus, Mamdani takes office and billionaires rage at a wealth tax. Ok, so I was going to do a year end review and predictions issue today for the anti-monopoly movement, but yesterday, the U.S. engaged in regime change in Venezuela. At the end of this post, I'll have the usual monopoly round-up, with lots of news. But we'll start with the situation in Venezuela, about which Wall Street is very excited . The best way to understand what just happened is to start with history. Because while Trump is unusually explicit about his rationalization for seizing control over a resource-rich territory, U.S. domination of the oil reserves of South America is not new. And neither is the fusion of corporate and state interest. Ninety five years ago, in 1931, Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon, who owned Gulf Oil (now Chevron), forced the President of Colombia to give his company the Barco oil concession, which borders Venezuela. How? Well Wall Street banks and the U.S. government threatened to withhold vitally needed bank loans if Colombia did not cede the franchise. The parallels to the situation today are there. When Mellon seized these reserves, in partnership with JP Morgan banking interests, gunboat diplomacy was the norm. In the prior two decades, the U.S. had finished brutally putting down a resistance movement in the Philippines, and had become the global economic and political power after a gruesome world war. Woodrow Wilson had tried to establish a global rules-based order, which the GOP in the 1920s sabotaged. At the time, Democrats were incompetent and split, as it was an era of deep reverence for the wealthy and bitter culture warring over race and alcohol. For instance, the head of the DNC in the late 1920s, a Dupont executive named John J. Raskob, published a pamphlet titled \"Everybody Ought to Be Rich\" encouraging Americans to borrow money to invest in the stock market. Just as there is increasing support for cynical and nihilistic figures today, many in the 1920s felt warmly towards Mellon, Mussolini, and authoritarianism in gener",

Pity the Venezuelans who have lived under dictators for nearly three decades. Now they have an authoritarian-in-abstentia. Trump attempting to run the show from 2,000 miles away is a disaster in the making. If the president believes for a second that he can bully Venezuela, get ready for a reality check.

We've been here before, in South America and farther afield, with dictators arguably worse than Nicol&#225;s Maduro. But never with an Oval Office occupant as unfit as Trump. How long before American lives are lost? Trump out-Trumped himself on Saturday when he used the United States military to capture President Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores. They were extradited to New York and charged with drug trafficking and weapons offenses, making their first court appearance today. Trump did not notify Congress as is required by the War Powers Act, though, apparently, he did inform oil executives of his plan. Nor did Venezuela engage in any hostile acts toward the United States that would justify the use of military force. The legal, moral, and political ramifications of such an abuse of power will become clearer as Maduro and Flores move through the justice system and Venezuela reorganizes after the sudden and deadly U.S. aggression. This is what happens when an unhinged, amoral man with a massive ego and enormous power has no guardrails. During his first term, Trump surrounded himself with loyalists who did their best to save Trump from himself.

A Stanford Medicine-led study , published in Science, found that blocking a &#8216;gerozyme' reverses cartilage loss in mice and human tissue. An injection that blocks the activity of a protein involved in aging reverses naturally occurring cartilage loss in the knee joints of old mice, a Stanford Medicine-led study has found. The treatment also prevented the development of arthritis after knee injuries mirroring the ACL tears often experienced by athletes or recreational exercisers. An oral version of the treatment is already in clinical trials with the goal of treating age-related muscle weakness. Samples of human tissue from knee replacement surgeries - which include both the extracellular scaffolding, or matrix, in the joint as well as cartilage-generating chondrocyte cells - also responded to the treatment by making new, functional cartilage. The study results suggest it may be possible to regenerate cartilage lost to aging or arthritis with an oral drug or local injection, rendering knee and hip replacement unnecessary. The treatment directly targets the cause of osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease that affects one of every five adults in the United States and is estimated to cost about $65 billion in direct health care costs each year.

O doctrine born of accelerants- inequality, climate, hunger, haste- you reveal how easily the world ignites, how a rumor becomes a border, how a border becomes a wound, how a wound becomes a fire. You teach us that global is not vastness but velocity, a fuse stretched across continents, carrying every spark farther than its maker intended. You remind us that jurisprudence is not parchment or precedent, but the trembling hand that decides whether to cool the world or kindle it.

Photo: Brian Gage The discourse today, front page of the Telegraph and the S*n, is that there's been yet another blow to the ailing pub industry. Is it taxes on alcohol, is it those pesky Gen Zs choosing a healthier less booze-filled lifestyle? Nope, this time it's *checks notes* a proposed reduction in the amount of alcohol that can be present in your breath/bloodstream before you get behind the wheel. Thanks for reading Sifting the Evidence - the relaunch!! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. Even at first glance, this feels like the height of entitlement to me. We know that drink driving is dangerous: there is decades and decades of evidence that alcohol, even at low levels, impairs our reaction times, impairs our hand-eye coordination, impairs our judgment. And cars are huge heavy metal boxes that can travel at high speeds. It's a recipe for disaster. And the stats back that up. While only 7% of drivers admit to drink driving, in 2022 17% of all road deaths involved at least one driver over the limit. But surely the drink-driving laws in the UK are regularly reviewed, to keep us all safe as our relationship with cars has evolved. You'd like to think so wouldn't you? But, no. The law as it currently stands in England and Wales was set in 1967 . That's just shy of 60 years ago! A lot has changed since then. In 1967 there were approximately 10 million cars on the road. Sounds like a lot, but in 2025 there were 42.3 million licensed vehicles , of which over 30 million are cars. So roads are likely to be 3 to 4x busier than they were when these laws were introduced. And what about cars themselves? Even in recent years the size and weight of cars has increased dramatically. According to Autocar the average weight of a car on the road in 2023 was 1947kg. I haven't found stats for the mid 60s, but by the end of the 1950s, car weights were on average 750-1650kg &#8211; a lot lighter. And cars have got taller ",

Held as a treasure by the University of Michigan for 80 years ; it was actually produced by the 20th-century forger Tobia Nicotra. Fakes are nothing new. Enrollment is everything. The argument about whether large language models can \"do science\" has the structure of a trap. The debate proceeds along predictable lines: enthusiasts point to protein folding, to materials science, to the generation of novel hypotheses; critics point to hallucination, to the absence of understanding, to the difference between pattern-matching and insight. But answer yes and you're a booster, answer no and you're a skeptic, and either way you've made the technology the protagonist. Both sides assume the only question worth asking is a capabilities question: what can these systems really \"do.\" This framing has a certain intuitive appeal, but it's the wrong question-or, more precisely, it's a question that forecloses the more interesting ones and leads us circling around questions with no grounding in social reality. There's a stealth neoplatonism embedded in the term \"scientific discovery,\" as if discoveries exist in some ideal realm waiting to be accessed-or in the video-game addled vocabulary of contemporary science policy-waiting to be \"unlocked.\" The debate is reduced to one about whether LLMs have the right kind of key. From a constructionist perspective-the tradition associated with Bruno Latour and science studies more broadly-this gets the epistemology backwards. Galileo's telescope didn't access some pre-existing truth about Jupiter's moons; the moons became scientific facts through a process of enrollment, as the telescope's outputs were taken up by institutions, integrated into arguments, and accepted as evidence. I'm a half-hearted Latourian at best, but on this point I'm a whole-hearted constructionist: whether LLMs can make \"scientific discoveries\" is no more interesting a question than whether Galileo's telescope \"really saw.\" 1",

    "text": "Using AI to REMOVE Propaganda Grok is a great example of an AI designed to give a politically biassed result. But what if you could use AI to remove political bias? The AIs most are using for free right now are based on large language models (LLMs) &#8211; they digest vast amounts of content and, from that, deduce rules about how to interpret what you give them. Because they are given so much compute power, and can consume so much content, they can quickly produce something that looks convincing. Of course, what looks convincing is often not true &#8211; ask any con man. With AIs this is particularly true for narrow subject areas. Ask then anything about Scottish Government policy, for example, and you'll find only a handful of referenced sources &#8211; many with strong political bias. Using an AI can easily generate political propaganda, dressed up as fact. But don't give up! AIs are still useful in other ways. For example, tidying up your text and checking grammar (you can probably tell I didn't use one in writing this article). They can also re-write text in different ways &#8211; e.g. pulling out key points or making a summary more engaging. You could probably do this yourself, but its just quicker with an AI to help.

But what happens when producers can't get their hands on the exact aircraft they want? That's when aeroplanes become true \"flying actors\" , stepping into roles as exotic enemy fighters, high-tech helicopters, or even fantastical sci-fi machines. With clever modifications, prosthetic add-ons, and imaginative paint schemes, these airborne stand-ins often steal the show-capturing viewers' imaginations and becoming just as beloved, or even more beloved, as the human stars on screen. 10: Puma to Hind Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985) featured what appeared to be a Soviet attack helicopter. For Western audiences at the time, this was an exotic sight, as the Cold War meant genuine Soviet aircraft were rarely, if ever, seen outside the Eastern Bloc. The imposing gunship became an iconic part of the film's Vietnam&#8209;style action. With red stars and Soviet&#8209;style camouflage, the helicopter bristled with what appeared to be rockets and mounted guns. In reality, it was a cleverly disguised A&#233;rospatiale SA 330 Puma, a French transport helicopter. Its transformation relied on cosmetic modifications, including large prosthetic wings, &#8216;missile' pods, and other attachments to give it a distinctly Soviet appearance. Puma to Hind The same airframe had previously performed a similar role in Red Dawn (1984) and later returned in subsequent Rambo films. Weapons added for effect included an M60 machine gun designed to resemble a Soviet DShK, a GE M134 Minigun styled as a YakB 12.7mm rotary gun, and an FN MAG styled as a PKM. The GE M134 was mounted beneath the faux \"Hind\" gunship, firing bursts of propane and acetylene to simulate muzzle flashes. Sound effects were added in post-production. The helicopter's prosthetic wings carried prop anti-tank missiles and unguided rocket pods, completing the convincing illusion of a Cold War&#8209;era atta",

I've been doing something at night after I get in bed that I wouldn't recommend to anyone with a sane synapse in their head. I have been watching YouTube videos of traffic stops by police. Dozens of them. No, hundreds. They are, in a word, addictive. Cell phones and police body cameras have made this phenomenon possible. For the most part, the videos show what appears to be police misconduct. An officer will turn on the lights of his patrol car and pull an alleged offender to the side of the road. The offense can be anything from speeding, to failure to signal a turn, to failure to stop at a light or stop sign, to not having a current registration sticker in the window of a car. The officer approaches the side of the car and asks to see the driver's license and registration and insurance. Sometimes the officer will approach a car parked on the side of the street, or a car in line at a fast food drive-through, and ask for the same documents. Sometimes, the driver who is sitting in a stopped car will ask why he has to provide these documents when he or she has not committed a traffic offense. The police officer usually persists, telling the driver he or she must produce identification on demand. Sometimes the drivers are aware of laws on the books or court decisions that say you don't have to produce identification on demand when you are not accused of a crime. That doesn't work to defuse the situation. This is what happens in those videos, over and over again. The officer says \"Get out of the car!\" or \"Get out of the fucking car.\" When the drivers don't act fast enough to exit the car, the officer opens the door and forcibly drags them out of the car and throws them on the ground. These are very violent confrontations. Sometimes, the driver films it on their own cell phone. Sometimes, it is filmed by a passenger with a cell phone. Often, the film from a police body cam emerges during a lawsuit against the officer for excessive use of force. When it turns out that the",

Thus, procreation aside, the optimal wealth distribution is not a question of ethics , but of epistemology : past what point does influence outstrip insight, wherein those governed collectively know too much more than they can ever communicate to their overlords, and their intuitions start to outperform their orders? \" The Epistemic Argument for Anarchism \" is what someone told me it was when I made it, before I'd ever even looked up the word \"Anarchism\" or Chomsky's definition , or Prodhoun's derivation of the concept he gave to the term when he coined it from the counter-cultural politics of Jesus Christ . This is how I made that argument in 2015 : \"1. The more information we can base our decisions on, the better our decisions can be. 2. The more we decentralize our decision-making, the less we must centralize information in order to base our decisions on it. 3. The less we must centralize information in order to base our decisions on it, the more information (in human consciousnesses) we can base our decisions on. 4.

Journalists are letting xAI off the hook by pretending the bot is responsible. Over the past week, users on X discovered something horrifying: strangers were replying to women's photos and asking Grok, the platform's built-in AI chatbot, to \"remove her clothes\" or \"put her in a bikini.\" And Grok was doing it. Publicly. In the replies. For everyone to see. This wasn't happening in some private chat window. Unlike other AI image generators that operate in closed environments, Grok posts its outputs directly to X, turning the platform into a public showcase of non-consensual sexualization.

Much worse. The Present Age is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. Last week, a user asked Grok to put two young girls in \"sexy underwear.\" Grok complied, generating and posting an image of children (estimated by the bot itself to be between 12 and 16 years old ) in sexualized clothing. Samantha Smith, a survivor of childhood sexual abuse , tested whether Grok would alter a childhood photo of her. It did. \"I thought &#8216;surely this can't be real,'\" she wrote on X. \"So I tested it with a photo from my First Holy Communion. It's real.

This matters because xAI deliberately built Grok to be \"less restricted\" than competitors. Last summer, the company introduced \"Spicy Mode,\" which permits sexually suggestive content.

RTZ #964 ...fast changing AI demand curves from Nvidia et al I've long discussed the criticality of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) for the global tech industry and increasingly the AI Tech Wave through the end of the decade at least.

And vs its growing concentration of business with Nvidia , Google and other critical AI chip customers in the next few years. Semianalysis provides a timely snapshot of the bookends in \" Apple-TSMC: The Partnership That Built Modern Semiconductors\" : \"In 2013, TSMC made a $10 billion bet on a single customer. Morris Chang committed to building 20nm capacity with uncertain economics on the promise that Apple would fill those fabs. \"I bet the company, but I didn't think I would lose,\" Chang later said. He was right. Apple's A8 chip launched in 2014, and TSMC never looked back.\" \"Apple's annual spend at TSMC grew from $2B in 2014 to $24B in 2025. That is 12x in 12 years. Apple went from 9% of TSMC revenue to 25% at its peak and settled to 20% in 2025. More striking is Apple's dominance at node launches: consistently >50% since 20nm and in some cases near 100%. Apple effectively funded the yield learning curve for every major node transition since 20nm.\" \"The foundry model is dominant today. IDMs cannot support process development and fab capex with what is effectively a single customer. But even foundries need a \"first and best\" customer with large demand and deep pockets to fund their continued advance. Apple has been that customer for the last decade at TSMC.

The official title was 15.S50 , but everybody came to know it as the &#8216;MIT poker class'. The course was the brainchild of PhD student Will Ma, who was studying Operations Research. He had played a lot of poker &#8211; and won a lot of money &#8211; while an undergraduate in Canada, which had made a lot of people curious when he arrived at MIT, including the head of department. 15.S50 was a legitimate MIT class; if students passed, they could get degree credit. I've always liked poker, both as a game and testing ground for wider ideas relating to uncertainty. Although poker has rules and limits, some key information is always concealed. The same problem crops up in many aspects of life. Negotiations, debates, bargaining; they are all incomplete information games. &#8216;Poker is a perfect microcosm of many situations we encounter in the real world,' as Jonathan Schaeffer, a pioneer of game playing AI, once told me. I interviewed Ma about the MIT poker class while researching The Perfect Bet . Perhaps understandably for a university course, the sessions focused on theory rather than gambling with real money. Given the relatively limited time available, Ma tried to focus on the steepest part of the learning curve. Here are some of the key takeaways when it comes to decision-making under uncertainty: Sometimes the optimal move feels reckless. To succeed in poker, you must be prepared to occasionally take a big calculated risk, or walk away from a situation you've sunk resources into. The best actions are often more extreme than a beginner is comfortable with. Confidence is about recovering from mistakes. In one class, lecturer Jennifer Shahade pointed out that &#8216;confidence is an underrated ingredient to success in chess and poker'. In particular, confident players expect to make errors and move on rather than let one mistake affect their game. Most people lose by doing too much. Wh",

Old Kingdom pyramids and images were not separate categories of architecture and art so much as interlocking technologies for making kingship durable. Old Kingdom pyramids and images were not separate categories of architecture and art so much as interlocking technologies for making kingship durable. In the 3rd and 4th Dynasties, the royal tomb changes from a mostly horizontal, enclosed mastaba tradition into a radically vertical monument that turns the dead king into a permanent feature of the landscape, and that new geometry reorganizes everything around it. How the afterlife is pictured, how cult is funded, how labor is mobilized, and how bodies (real and represented) are disciplined into ideals. What looks to modern eyes like a leap in engineering is also a leap in political theology, because the pyramid does not merely house the king; it stages the king's continuing function as guarantor of cosmic order and as the state's organizing principle (Lehner; Verner). That is why Old Kingdom form tends toward the absolute; massive stone, controlled profiles, standardized proportions, repeated images, and tightly managed access. The system is designed to outlast weather, time, and human unreliability, and it does so by distributing \"presence\" across architecture, sculpture, text, and ritual in redundant layers (Metropolitan Museum of Art, Egypt in the Old Kingdom). The mastaba background matters because it establishes the older grammar that the pyramid will intensify rather than erase. Elite mastabas and their chapels already frame the tomb as a place where the living sustain the dead through offerings, recitation, and images that keep identity socially legible. A false door on a west wall, for example, is not decoration; it is an engineered threshold where the dead receive offerings and where the living direct speech and ritual toward a specific person whose name, titles, and images fix them in relation to family, office, and land (Metropolitan Museum of Art, False Door from the Tomb of Metjetji).

Western governments are going to get more and more authoritarian. Police forces are going to get more and more militarized and murderous. Freedom of speech is going to be crushed with more and more aggression. Military budgets are going to get more and more bloated. The imperial war machine is going to get more and more belligerent, genocidal and expansionist. The gap between the rich and the poor is going to keep growing and growing. People are going to get more and more miserable and mentally unhealthy. The systems we use to gather information about our world are going to get more and more tightly controlled by the powerful. The extraction of resources and labor from the global south will get more and more abusive and overt. The biosphere we depend on for survival is going to get closer and closer to death. How do we know this will happen? Because that's all that's been happening. This is all the US-led capitalist world order has ever been doing. This is all they have to offer us. More and more murder and abuse is the only item on the menu we've been handed. We can't vote our way out of this dilemma. How do we know? Because we've been trying to vote our way out of it for generations. One party does evil things, then people vote in the other party to get away from the evil and the new party does evil things, then they try the other evil party again, etc, etc, etc. The whole system is locked down. The abuses have been baked into the cake. Everything about our civilization has been rigged to ensure the wealthy and powerful get more and more wealth and power while everyone else gets more and more poverty, exhaustion, ignorance, and insanity. The only unlocked door out of this dystopian nightmare is the people using the power of their numbers to force real change.

Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. The vitality of the American experiment relies heavily upon the \"Fourth Estate\"-a press corps dedicated to the objective scrutiny of power and the dissemination of truth. However, the contemporary media landscape has witnessed the rise of a corrosive alternative: the personality-driven agitator who masquerades as a news anchor while functioning as a primary agent of institutional erosion. Within this context, Jesse Watters of Fox News represents a critical threat to the stability of civil society and the protection of American rights. By weaponizing cruelty against the vulnerable, deploying sexually exploitative rhetoric against professional women, and serving as a dedicated apologist for the Trump-Vance political regime, Watters has effectively abandoned the principles of journalism in favor of a Social Darwinist and authoritarian agenda. The Systematic Stigmatization of Vulnerable Populations and the Doctrine of Cruelty A cornerstone of a healthy civil society is the shared commitment to human dignity, particularly for those marginalized by systemic failures. Jesse Watters' rhetorical output consistently seeks to dismantle this commitment, replacing it with a framework of public shaming and exclusionary judgment. His treatment of the unhoused population in American cities serves as a primary case study in this ideological shift. Watters has frequently characterized homelessness not as a failure of housing policy or psychiatric care, but as a moral choice by \"drug addicts that want to wander around and live in tents on the sidewalk\".[1] By framing poverty through the lens of \"anti-social behavior,\" W",

It was tough taking two weeks off from the newsletter. Over that time I collected so many resources that I wanted to share, making it really difficult to choose what to include this week! If you are new to RDM Weekly, the content of this newsletter is divided into 3 categories: &#9989; What's New in RDM? These are resources that have come out within the last year or so &#9989; Oldies but Goodies These are resources that came out over a year ago but continue to be excellent ones to refer to as needed &#9989; Just for Fun A data management meme or other funny data management content What's New in RDM?

Open Science: My Insights Into Data Sharing, Preregistration, and Replication After a decade of implementing open science practices as a principal investigator, mentor, data repository founder, and Editor-in-Chief, Sara Hart has learned that the question isn't whether researchers should adopt these practices, but how to adapt them meaningfully. This commentary, based on a talk given at the 2024 CSBBCS conference, argues for two key principles: first, open science implementation must be context-dependent rather than one-size-fits-all, and second, practical research realities require flexible approaches to idealized policies. 2. 50-State Comparison: State Data Dictionaries and Manuals States often publish data dictionaries or manuals that showcase which data elements their systems collect. This resource links to every public education-to-workforce data dictionary, data manual, or related document the Education Commission of the States identified in early care and education, K-12, postsecondary and workforce data systems across all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

    "text": "The Republican Health Care Trilemma Republicans want three things about health insurance, but it's only possible to have two, which is why they can't come up with a health care policy. Dear readers, Most Republicans, including the president, do not want to extend the enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that Democrats first enacted during the pandemic. But they also don't want to sound like they don't care about skyrocketing health insurance premiums. So we're back in yet another cycle of Republicans saying they're going to reform the health care system to make it much cheaper and better, and as always, there's really no plan - not even the \"concepts of a plan\" the president promised he had during last year's campaign. Instead, there's just a lot of complaining that health insurance is too expensive, and vague claims that Republicans can make it cheaper by unleashing the markets and consumer choice. Back in 2017, former House Speaker John Boehner said this about Republicans and health care: \"In the 25 years that I served in the United States Congress, Republicans never, ever, one time agreed on what a health care proposal should look like. Not once.\" Eight years later, that remains true, and here's why: (most) Republicans want a health insurance system that does three things - or rather, that doesn't do three things: It should not force people to buy health insurance if they don't want to. It should not spend a lot of taxpayer money subsidizing health insurance. It should not allow insurers to discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions. The problem for Republicans is it is only possible to have, at most, two out of those three things. In an unregulated market, you could have (1) and (2). It would suck for people with cancer, but it is a theoretically possible policy to enact. The trouble is with (3) - (3) is a rule that ensures that health insurance isn't a normal kind of insurance, and to make the abnormal insurance market work, you have to abandon either (1) or (2) (or both). The key thing to understand about health insurance is that if it worked the way auto or homeowner's insurance works, we would not be very happy. This is bec",

The what? The debt ceiling is the maximum amount of money the United States can borrow. Our government borrows money when the Treasury Department issues government securities, or treasury bonds, that other countries and institutions buy. That infuses the government with cash, and it means our debt is owned by U.S. institutions, the U.S. public, and other nations. The debt ceiling was created in 1917 under the Liberty Bond Act as a way to rein in government spending and increase the efficiency of our borrowing. In essence, the goal wa",

From everyone at MAIEI, we wish you optimism and strength as we navigate through the AI ethics space. Collective Action: In Part V of the State of AI Ethics Report (SAIER), we explore emerging initiatives seeking to reclaim decision power regarding AI, across literacy, civil society and government. Recess: Your wrist, your data, their access: Are you trading convenience for control? This week marks the return of our Recess series, a collaboration with Encode Canada that showcases student insights into current AI applications. This week's piece analyzes AI wearables and the ethical grey areas that arise regarding privacy and data collection. What connects these stories: 2026 has certainly begun on a low note, with tensions hastily increasing across America. But it is in this context that we call on our readers to find optimism in the good things that make us human. Empathy, care and compassion are just some of the things we can share with one another and with nature; a collective demonstration of solidarity that transcends the superfluous relations dictated by many social norms. It is in this context that many initiatives challenging social systems have emerged. Collective action is given centre stage in the final part of the SAIER . Unionization, as Ana Brandusescu (McGill University) notes, has become a major force for good across AI ecosystems and may continue to be a key to future movements resisting AI in 2026.

    "text": "The Very Simple Case For Utilitarianism  All interests are equal, and only interests matter A lot of non-utilitarians don't really see the draw of utilitarianism. 1 To them, we're a curious bunch. We think it's great to kill people and harvest their organs ( in an idealized case , of course). We care about shrimp. What the hell is going on? Now, I don't really think caring about shrimp is limited to utilitarians -if anything, maybe deontologists should care about them more . But I want to try to communicate what I consider to be the core motivation behind utilitarianism. Not beating the stereotypes At the most basic level, I think utilitarianism follows if you think the following two things: Everyone's interests count equally. Nothing else counts more than someone's interests. Note: when I say counts I mean \"should influence decision-making.\" Utilitarianism says you should maximize aggregate welfare. If you think everyone's welfare matters the same amount and nothing matters apart from that, then you'll think we should maximize aggregate welfare. So you'll end up a utilitarian. Both of these premises strike me as pretty intuitive. It's not incoherent to deny them, and there are some intuitions that conflict with them, but they strike me as pretty natural moral starting points. Thinking them through helps illustrate what's weird about non-utilitarian verdicts. Take, for example, the view that nature has intrinsic value. This view would deny 2. It would hold that sometimes, if you're deciding between someone's interests and preserving nature, you should preserve nature. But that's pretty weird. Nature isn't a person. It has no thoughts or experiences. If we're trading off helping someone with helping no one, but simply adorning the world with more pretty nature, it strikes me as very odd to prioritize nature. We shouldn't make one person worse-off if doing so makes no one better-off. Note: this isn't the only reason I reject that nature has intrinsic value. I have other arguments. But I'm just trying to illustrate the structure of the core utilitarian view. ",

The New Zealand government's handling of prescription co-payment fees for 12-month prescriptions reveals a troubling pattern of policy incompetence, poor planning, and inadequate consideration of patient welfare. The reversal of the original decision to charge patients $5 every three months exposes significant flaws in the government's decision-making processes and healthcare policy implementation. The Policy Reversal: What Happened In May 2025, as part of Budget 2025, the government initially decided that patients would need to pay a $5 co-payment fee every three months when collecting medicines under the new 12-month prescription policy. This decision was made specifically \"to mitigate the financial impact on Health New Zealand,\" as revealed by RNZ . However, Cabinet documents released just before Christmas revealed that this decision was rescinded in September 2025, with patients now only paying the fee once at the first collection. Health Minister Simeon Brown admitted in Cabinet papers that \"the previous decision does not align with the policy intent to reduce costs to patients,\" according to RNZ's reporting . This statement is damning-it reveals the government made a decision in May that fundamentally contradicted its own stated policy objectives. The reversal means patients will save up to $15 annually, but it will cost Health NZ between $6 million and $23 million per year, with costs estimated to grow by approximately 5% annually, as reported by the NZ Herald . Fundamental Policy Incompetence Contradicting Stated Objectives The government announced 12-month prescriptions as a way \"to reduce the cost of seeing GPs\" and remove \"unnecessary barriers for patients,\" as stated in RNZ's coverage . Yet the initial decision to charge patients $5 every three months for a year-long prescription directly undermined this goal. This represents a fundamental failure of policy coherence-designing a cost-saving measure that would actually increase costs for patients with chr",

Apologies for being absent on this front for a few weeks but&#8230; [gestures at the general state of the world]. Been having trouble writing generally, and didn't think anyone really wanted an essay about some spurious connection between anal sex and COVID-19. Anyway. I hope you are well. I hope you are staying safe and social distancing. Let's try this again. There's a line in Toni Bentley's The Surrender that I am currently too lazy to look up and quote for you verbatim. The gist, however, is along the lines of this: the asshole - by virtue of its reluctant nature - is fundamentally more honest than the vagina. While the vagina might open up, lubricate, and let a guest in regardless of the emotional state or willingness of the person attached to it; an asshole is significantly more intransigent, resisting entry unless one is utterly, completely willing. The first time I read this line I was struck by a fundamental truth contained within; one musing on the difficult of forcing oneself to just lie back and take it. I have, regrettably, had times* when I wanted to want anal penetration more than I actually wanted it; in those scenarios, my ass, sensing my hesitation, did not easily give way, and, well, the episode did not end well. But the more I have sat with that line, the more uncomfortable it makes me. For starters, I do not love the idea of the body - and specifically the body's erogenous zones - as some unparalleled truth teller. There's an entire chapter of my book that takes apart the far too common belief that vaginal arousal supersedes the presence or absence of verbal consent: if I don't think that a wet pussy overrides a person's no, or provides the real prove of whether or not they want sex, it's hard for me to argue that the asshole should be anything different. Because, of course, the ugly endpoint of the assertion that the anus is incapable of telling a lie is the belief that anyone who successfully takes it up the ass must necessarily be doing it wi",

According to a recent Harvard Business School meta-analysis of 18 studies, women have 22% lower odds of using generative AI websites and apps than men, both at work and in everyday life. And this pattern holds across countries, sectors, occupations, and tools. Between 2022 and 2024, women accounted for roughly 42% of global users of ChatGPT and Perplexity websites, and just 31% of Anthropic's. On smartphones, the gap widens even further: only 27% of ChatGPT app downloads come from women. The oft-proposed explanation is that women understand this new technology less, largely because they work in roles with lower exposure to it. Women are, after all, still outnumbered in STEM degrees and careers , including in AI-specific roles . The same is true in AI leadership&#8202;-&#8202;women hold fewer than 14% of senior executive positions in the industry. But Harvard's study also found that the usage gap remains even when women are explicitly given opportunities to learn and use AI tools.

This is the third in a series of posts where I aim to lay out my current thoughts on the relationship between these fields - and the career options in them - in the present research environment. Everything here is my personal opinion; almost any claim I make some researchers would stridently disagree with. So take it with a grain of salt. In the past two posts , I've laid out where I think cognitive science can and can't be useful for AI. Here, I want to look the other direction, and talk about lessons that I think cognitive (neuro)science can learn from AI. This post will largely follow a preprint that Wilka Carvalho and I wrote arguing for a similar perspective, though here I'll give a more succinct argument with a slightly different focus. What should cognitive science learn from AI? At a high level, I think that cognitive science can learn from AI that: Scale and richness of learning experiences can fundamentally change learning & generalization. Thus, the solutions to toy problems are not necessarily the best solutions for problems at scale - especially if the toy problems are constructed to demonstrate one's pet theory (be careful of \"setting your own homework\"). And the computational solutions to tasks individually may be quite different from the solution that solves them all relatively well. Natural intelligence operates in the regime of learning at scale, and solving many tasks. But most cognitive models focus on solving an extremely narrow task - a single, simple experimental paradigm. This mismatch can limit our ability to achieve understanding. As I said in the first post of this series , an adaptive system can be like a mirror - if you're not careful, the system just reflects the structure in which you test it. Thus, in order to understand such a system, it's",

In response to the declaration of a state of emergency due to the imminent danger associated with heavy rains in 382 districts across 20 regions of the country, the Ministry of Health (Minsa) recommends that residents of dengue-prone areas adopt preventative measures, such as identifying and eliminating mosquito breeding sites around their homes. Image/CDC The Directorate of Prevention and Control of Vector-Borne Diseases and Zoonoses (Dpcem) emphasized this recommendation because the rains increase the number of mosquito breeding sites, thus facilitating the transmission of dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses. They also explained that mosquito breeding sites are any containers or objects that can collect water, whether from rain or improper storage, where mosquitoes lay their eggs to reproduce. The main breeding grounds for mosquitoes are tanks, drums, water jugs, vase bases, pet water bowls, toys, bottles, tires, bottle caps, eggshells, coconut or cacao husks, abandoned plastic pools, among others.

I have long posted on studies that try to make sense of how human values differ, and how they have changed over time. A new paper in Social Science Quarterly tries to compare four different proposed values models, by modeling the network of correlations of the variables they see as central. This diagram shows their key result: three clumps of 2-4 named clusters, each of which has 3-10 correlated variables: Alas that paper doesn't give names for the particular variables, and some of the clump names seem overly opaque. But what I can see is still interesting. The bottom of the diagram seem to be items most closely related to status. The lower right clump (called \"virtuous agency\") matters most to modern elites, while the middle clump (called \"power and social order\") mattered more in the farming era. Did the upper right clump (called \"hierarchical individualism\") matter most to foragers, and also matter more now due to a toward-forager modern culture trend? I've suggested that many modern differences are due to moderns seeing themselves as higher status, due to their higher wealth. If so, that virtuous agency would also have mattered more to farming era elites, while the power and social order clump should matter more to non-elites today.",

    "text": "Assembling the Pieces: From Assembly Text to Binary Objects Your compiler spits out assembly, but computers don’t run text files, so what happens next? Introduction In our last article , we looked inside the compiler and saw how it builds an Abstract Syntax Tree, checks your syntax, and generates assembly code, those mov , call , and ret instructions. We generated main.s and source.s using g++ -S . Those are text files you can read. But your CPU doesn't execute text. It needs binary machine code which are ones and zeros. That's where the assembler comes in. The assembler's job is dead simple: take assembly text ( .s files) and translate each instruction into its binary equivalent. The output is an object file ( .o on Linux, .obj on Windows). These are chunks of machine code, but they're not complete programs yet. They have missing pieces such as references to functions in other files or libraries. That's what the linker will fix in Part 5. In this part, we'll compile our code into separate object files using -c (full form: --compile ). Then we'll use objdump to inspect those binary blobs and see what symbols (functions, variables) they contain. By the end, you'll understand why compiling large projects file-by-file is faster and how \"separate compilation\" works. Thanks for reading Low-Level Lore! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. Next up, we'll roll up our sleeves and assemble some object files. Separate Compilation Flow: From C++ Source Files to Binary Object Files (.o) The Assembler's Job: Text to Binary Grab the assembly files from last time ( main.s , source.s ). If you don't have them: g++ -S main.cpp -o main.s g++ -S source.cpp -o source.s Now let's assemble them into object files. Use the -c flag to compile without linking: g++ -c main.s -o main.o g++ -c source.s -o source.o List your files: ls *.o You'll see main.o and source.o . These are binary files. Open one in a text editor and it's gibberish. That's machine code. Your computer understands it; you don't (unless you're a wizard). Why not just do this in one step? You can.

    "text": "Why Modern Art The public has apparently consistently disliked modernist artistic styles in many areas, including architecture: The public has apparently consistently disliked modernist artistic styles in many areas, including architecture: Americans prefer traditional/classical buildings to modern ones by about 70% to 30% (regardless of political affiliation!). In a poll of America's favorite architecture, 76% of buildings selected were traditional/classical. A study of courthouse architecture determined that &#8230; &#8216;most non-architects dislike &#8216;modern' design and have done so for almost a century.' Yet 92% of new federal government buildings are modern. ( More ) Which raises the question of why such styles are so often chosen. The obvious proximate answer is that elites choose them to impress other elites, who tend to prefer specialist not popular evaluations, even when they represent democratic governments. But why do they do this? Scott Alexander, author of the above quote, suggests as explanations: elites trying to hide not flaunt wealth, getting out of touch with popular tastes, becoming more Protestant, seeing timeless aesthetic truths, responding to rising labor costs, splitting off from popular tastes, or signaling taste instead of wealth. Samuel Hughes says: Modernism was driven by artists & the intellectual circles that surrounded them. In the case of some arts, &#8230; music &#8230; literature, it never really left those circles: &#8230; In &#8230; other art forms, rich people were eventually drawn in to some degree. ( more ) Which seems right, but raises the question of why artists diverged and how they were able to get away with it. When search for explanations of social trends, it seems better if possible to focus on trends which one well understands in fundamental terms, so one needn't ask what caused those trends. And one such key trend for understand the modern world is: the rise of professions. Medieval guilds declined greatly in power after ~1600.

Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. Over the past several months, I've been working to articulate a clear vision for what higher education could look like if we truly designed systems around what students need to thrive. Drawing from my experiences in New Jersey, the Obama administration, and years of working on these issues from multiple vantage points, I've developed two companion documents that I'm sharing today. The Vision and the Framework I'm sharing these not as finished products, but as contributions to an ongoing conversation. The Student-Centered Principles for Higher Education Reform offer a framework for policymakers, institutional leaders, funders, and advocates. They articulate 10 principles across six domains. The Principles acknowledge complexity and tradeoffs-they're meant to be a starting point for the hard work of policy development and implementation. A Student Bill of Rights for Higher Education translates those principles into something more direct: a declaration of what every student pursuing postsecondary education deserves. It's written for students and the broader public-a stake in the ground about the experience we should be guaranteeing. The Principles are where we work through the \"how.\" The Bill of Rights is where we plant a flag on what students deserve. A preview of the toplines included within both documents is below; the actual text of each is linked throughout this post.

Yesterday, campaigners from Protect the Wild, Animal Rising, and members of the public came together in London for a Day of Action against the government's attempt to quietly expand anti-protest powers under the Public Order Act. We gathered outside the Home Office with one clear demand: withdraw the proposal to classify animal testing facilities as \"key national infrastructure.\" If pushed through, this change could mean that simply standing peacefully with a sign outside an animal testing facility is treated as a national security threat, carrying the risk of up to a year in prison. This action did not happen in isolation. It came off the back of an extraordinary public response : 5,000+ people emailing the Home Secretary in the last 48 hours Hundreds of handwritten postcards sent Almost 20,000 people emailing their MP More than 7,000 emails sent to members of the House of Lords Yesterday was about making that opposition visible and impossible to ignore. Shut out of the Home Office At 11am , representatives from Protect the Wild and Animal Rising attempted to formally hand in an open letter to the Home Secretary , urging the government to withdraw the proposal. We were refused . Despite the scale of public concern, campaigners were told the letter could not be accepted because we did not have a named contact inside the building. That refusal spoke volumes. A government willing to rush through sweeping new protest restrictions, but unwilling to even accept a letter expressing peaceful opposition, is not acting in the spirit of democratic accountability. Taking the message to Parliament After being turned away from the Home Office, we headed to Parliament to take the message directly to MPs. Campaigners engaged MPs through green carding , making sure concerns about the proposal were raised face-to-face, not buried in committee papers or brushed aside as a technicality. \"This line must not be crossed\" \"This proposal isn't just about animal testing.

I've been thinking about the challenges of singing a fugue and its relevance to everyday life. A quick and crude explanation for the non-musicians reading &#8211; in choral music, and elsewhere, a fugue consists of a theme, or themes, sung in one part and taken up by the others at different times, with some variations, overlapping and building, weaving together an interlocking and exhilarating piece of music. It can be a challenge to sing. Why a challenge? First, your entries as a singer can come fast and furious with little in the way of assistance from the other lines of music &#8211; the weave makes cues difficult to pick up on. The singer has to be alert, counting (sometimes furiously), watching the conductor, keeping an eye on his place in the score, confident in coming in, and accurate. Second, losing your place in the piece is a real danger and, if you do, finding a way back in is tricky because of the nature of the form. There's just too much going on. It's all a little nerve racking &#8211; and, yes, exhilarating. It struck me that singing a fugue is a little like navigating a complicated world in the need to be aware of everything around us, but at the same time staying focussed on our part in it &#8211; confident of when to come in and what to &#8216;sing' but not too certain, too arrogant, too complacent. The singer who is certain of his or her entries without paying any attention to what is going on around them is riding for a fall and could even bring the whole thing crashing down (that's the nightmare). Singing, like life, is a communal activity and if the pace alters, the musical director decides to take it a little faster maybe, the singer has to be able to adjust, cannot be too certain. That would be dangerous. The spark for these musings was a passage in Colin Heber-Percy's book, Lost in the Forest , in which he talks about the dangers of certainty in the wider world.

The upload comes weeks after Musk started pathetically begging MrBeast to post his videos to X. Also, last week, declared that X was a \"video-first platform\". So he's now spinning MrBeast's first full-length upload as a big win to celebrate. MrBeast had previously said he wasn't going to post anything to X because his videos are too expensive to waste them there. (My words, not his lol.) Neither Musk or MrBeast, however, have acknowledged that this wasn't an exclusive video for X, nor is it even a new video. It premiered on his YouTube channel back in September. But the fact MrBeast has finally soft-embraced X, the everything app that is also now a video-first app, is useful for measuring X's current level of decay. As of this morning, the original upload of \"$1 vs $100,000,000 Car,\" on YouTube has 212 million views. After about two days on X, it has 78 million. Which seems pretty good until you realize those are views for the X post the video is embedded in. It seems like not an accident that we can no longer see views on X videos anymore. The post has 29,000 shares, which means it's getting about an average of 2,600 passive views every time someone shares it. Though, I'm sure a bulk of those views come from Musk's followers. And, unlike when you watch it on YouTube, there weren't any ads that played ahead of it when I watched it. There is a sponsored segment towards the end of the video, which may be why they used this one. And there were a few (disclosed) ads in the replies beneath it. \"I'm super curious how much the ad revenue will make,\" MrBeast posted. Musk didn't respond to that, but separately replied, \"It's a great time to be a content creator on &#120143;.\" My guess is it will not make nearly as much as it made on YouTube.

Kinderachtig eigenlijk wel, want ik verkeerde de laatste weken toch al in een Bowie-fase.

In de weken ervoor was ik twee keer naar de Bowie-tentoonstelling in het Groninger Museum geweest en Blackstar (dat nog maar twee dagen uit was, maar waarvan ik de singles volledig had grijsgedraaid) bestempelde ik op het eerste gehoor tot het niveau van zijn klassiekers, zonder te weten dat dit zijn zwanenzang zou blijken.

Later today I will speak in Parliament about the collapse of modern languages. As I was preparing my remarks, an uncomfortable truth dawned: my own Duolingo habit is less a virtuous routine than a cleverly engineered addiction. Despite a fiercely defended streak and countless virtual crowns, I still cannot really speak Spanish - not in any way that matters. I could not negotiate a contract, comfort a friend or navigate a sensitive conversation where tone, timing and cultural cues matter as much as vocabulary. On the flight to my Christmas break, looking down over India - a country with 22 officially recognised languages and more than 2,000 recorded across census and linguistic surveys - the gap between my gamified \"learning\" and real linguistic capability felt huge.

When we mishear or misread in this environment, the cost is not just lost business. It is escalation, mistrust and, at worst, conflict. And this raises an awkward but important question. We have a Prime Minister who, I think, only speaks English. The head of our foreign intelligence service could not get away with this lack of skill.

While the launch confirms the operational limitations of the missile system, the strike also highlights the dilemma the missile poses for European defense. Thanks for reading Missile Matters - with Fabian Hoffmann! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. Capability profile The Oreshnik appears to be an intermediate-range ballistic missile with an estimated maximum range of roughly 3,000 to 5,500 kilometers. It is reportedly equipped with up to six MIRVed payloads that independently reenter the atmosphere to strike separate aimpoints. Each payload is said to carry up to six submunitions released during the terminal phase of flight, producing area effects around the intended target. Operational use suggests that the missile carries an inert payload, meaning it is not equipped with high explosives. Instead, lethality derives from the mass and velocity of the submunitions upon impact. Given the high terminal velocity of the payload (estimated at Mach 10-11 by some Russian and Ukrainian sources, though this likely represents an upper bound), even relatively light submunitions can impart substantial kinetic energy, sufficient to cause serious damage to above-ground concrete structures. The missile's genealogy can be traced to the RS-26 Rubezh, which was developed between 2008 and 2018 but was mothballed before reaching full operational capability. The RS-26 was conceived, tested, and publicly presented as a nuclear delivery system. As a result, the Oreshnik is very likely dual-capable, meaning it can carry both non-nuclear and nuclear payloads. It remains unclear whether Russia has already certified the Oreshnik for nuclear delivery, although doing so should be technically straightforward and would likely require only limited adaptations, such as rebalancing the missile to account for changes in weight distribution.

Average frequency of consumption of study recommended and restricted foods. A study published in December showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection, even mild or asymptomatic, caused a vast amount of methylation changes in those infected compared to controls. We identified DNAm changes at 42 CpG sites associated with anti&#8209;SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 antibody levels. We additionally report EWAS between COVID&#8209;19 cases and controls, with the case status being confirmed by either an antibody test or a PCR test.

Differential DNA methylation 7 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s13148-025-01866-4.pdf The observed hypermethylation is tied to two common sites, in particular.

Studies showed that AFAP1L2 was upregulated in A549-ACE2 cells [37], human nasal epithelial cells [38], and mouse kidneys after SARS-CoV-2 infection [39]. According to data from blood cell lines, cg17126990 overlapped both a DNasel hypersensitivity and an open chromatin regions, which suggests this CpG is involved in the transcription process [40].

CES used to stand for \"Consumer Electronics Show\", but after this year's CES, maybe we should think of a new name for the AI slopfest and niche-hobby-for-billionaires circlejerk.

But, being a normal person with a love of consumer electronics, it really hit home for me after hearing all of the reports coming out of CES 2026 that the big problem with the consumer tech industry (well, one of the big problems) is this: We (non-billionaire consumers) don't&#8230; really want products, anymore?

You can only make a picture look so good before your job, as the tech company creating the medium by which to distribute the creative work of others, is over. But we need to sell new TVs, so we need to convince people that there is still something wrong with their current TVs, that this industry is \"innovating\" and worthwhile. So let's slap a chatbot on a television and call it an innovation. Our phones are peak. They're powerful little computers in our pockets that can connect us to others instantly no matter where in the world we are. There is nothing left for Apple or Android to sell us- we've already got what we want. Probably the only thing that would get me to buy a new phone (beyond planned obsolescence making it necessary) is better battery life. But that's not as exciting as when the first iPhone came out.

Psychology, work, trauma, romance, art- all of it relates back to some thing some teacher or classmate said during a slim four years more than a decade ago.

If you've never done it before, you might be reading that sentence and thinking, what on earth are you on about. Dot watching is, quite simply, following the progress of someone in a race via an online tracker. Each runner is represented by a dot or pin on a map, usually with their bib number attached, and as they move through the course, so does the dot. It's most commonly used for really long ultramarathons where competitors are out on the course for days rather than hours. The reason so many people will be dot watching tomorrow is because it's the start of the winter Spine Race , a series of races including the \"brutal\" 268-mile race along the Pennine Way. This legendary race is where Jasmin Paris rose to international fame when she won the event outright whilst breastfeeding her daughter, back in 2019 (this story forms the start of my co-authored book Ultra Women ). Meanwhile the summer version of the race was won outright by 55-year-old Anna Troup in 2025, and she chatted to me about the challenge just days afterwards. So why is dot watching so appealing and what can it tell us about a race? Read more",

Share For nearly three decades, Dr. Stuart Hameroff has been swimming against the scientific mainstream with a radical idea: consciousness doesn't emerge from the firing of neurons alone, but from quantum processes happening inside the microscopic structures within our brain cells. What seemed like fringe science in the 1990s is now finding unexpected support from cutting-edge research, forcing us to reconsider one of humanity's greatest mysteries. Dr. Hameroff's journey into consciousness research began with a simple observation that troubled him during his medical training. As an anesthesiologist at the University of Arizona, he watched patients slip in and out of consciousness daily, yet the medical community had no real explanation for how these drugs worked their magic. His department chair's challenge echoed in his mind: \"If you want to understand consciousness, figure out how anesthesia works because we don't know how it works.\" While most neuroscientists focused on neurons-the brain's nerve cells-Hameroff looked deeper. His research revealed that anesthetics seemed to target something much smaller: structures called microtubules inside the neurons themselves. These tiny protein tubes, which he describes as resembling \"hollow ears of corn,\" are part of every cell's internal scaffolding. But Hameroff suspected they might be doing something far more profound than just providing structural support. The breakthrough came when Hameroff discovered Sir Roger Penrose's 1989 book \" The Emperor's New Mind .\" The Nobel Prize-winning physicist argued that consciousness couldn't be explained by classical computation alone, so it had to be quantum in nature. But Penrose lacked a biological mechanism for explaining how quantum effects could exist in the warm, wet environment of the brain. Reading Penrose's work, Hameroff had his eureka moment: \"Damn straight, Roger. It's freaking microtubules.\" The anesthesiologist reached out to the physicist, and their collaboration would",

It's a brilliant, poignant, horrifying book. It's an apocalypse in slow motion. But at the same, it's our imminent future if we don't act. If we don't change. Authors can afford to slowly construct plots and narratives. But in reality, we're accelerating towards something humanity has never experienced before. Photo by Anany Khare on Unsplash There's a line in the book that keeps coming back to me: \"you wake up and you're in a bad movie from the future.\" That's what it feels like right now. The news this week should terrify us all. Ireland is set to miss its emissions-reduction target by half. By half. Read that again. And again. And yet this fact was treated, ironically, as \"back of the envelope stuff\" by both the minister and much of the media. The Irish Times piece, titled \"Ireland will miss emissions-cut target by half, says Minister for Climate Darragh O'Brien,\" reads almost like a feel-good article. The final sentence in the article: \"He (Minister O'Brien) said the Luas extension to Finglas could go out for tender during 2026, allowing a possible start in 2027 and a possible completion date as early as 2030.\" A four kilometre LUAS extension will do nothing to our national emissions. The following day, we learned that the Government is ploughing ahead with legislation to scrap the Dublin Airport passenger cap. The Irish Times responded by writing that the cap \"finally could be laid to rest in 2026.\" Finally laid to rest. Millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide will be emitted as a consequence of this decision. People will die. It's a betrayal of future and current generations. But the Irish Times article made no mention of emissions, climate change, or human health. It did, however, find space for what felt like free advertising for airlines: more routes, more destinations. Woohoo, no more cap. It feels like waking up in some terrible futuristic horror movie. Except it isn't the future",

Movie theater air conditioning is a feeling about the mall and other people's cars, anonymizing and blank. Every movie theater is every other movie theater; I open the door from the street and I'm not in New York, but in America, its corporatizing vastness, its false comforts, its faith in an unbroken timeline.

In here, we're all pretending that we still live in the fuck-around century . We buy too many snacks and put too much butter on too much popcorn. Movies aren't cheap but they're cheaper than just about anything else, in this city, anyway. I've tried to shed so many versions of myself and succeeded maybe more than I should have, but who I was at this movie theater ten years ago and twenty years ago is who I am at this movie theater now, happy to be inside the air conditioning with a fistful of sugar and a faceful of light, wasting a slow afternoon in the cool and the dark, in the museum of the obsolete. The Lincoln Square AMC is objectively terrible and also the best movie theater in New York City or maybe the world. Most movie theaters are pretty bad, but this one is worse, which is to say, it's the best one.

The premise is simple: if advanced AI (or AGI, which I will use interchangeably) automates most labor and the wage share collapses, who will buy the increased output? If firms anticipate weak demand, will they keep investing and producing? Will the economy face a gap between potential and realized output, and actually shrink? Let's take a simple parable, suggested to me by Tom Cunningham, that illustrates this logic. Imagine there's an island with 100 workers and 10 capital owners. Everyone consumes two types of goods, fish and coconuts. Workers catch fish and harvest coconuts using nets and ladders provided by the capital owners. Workers are paid wages for their labor and spend everything they earn on the two goods. Revenue goes directly to the owners. The owners are wealthy, and because a person can only eat so many fish and coconuts, they consume 10 of each per day and have their fill. Thanks for reading Ghosts of Electricity! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. Now let's say fishing gets automated. Someone invents self-operating nets that catch fish without workers. Workers are fully displaced from fishing and move on to harvesting coconuts, which still requires labor. Workers still earn wages, and because fish has now become much cheaper, they may be even better off than before as their earnings can now buy them more of the two goods. Output rises in this economy: owners respond to demand by investing in nets and labor is now fully devoted to coconuts. But suppose someone invents an automatic harvester that picks coconuts, and there are enough of these harvesters to fully replace workers in the groves as well. Both sectors are now fully automated and the workers cannot be re-deployed elsewhere. They earn nothing and spend nothing. What happens to output? Well owners are still satiated with 10 fish and coconuts each. That's 200 units of total demand. Machines ",

In the fog of polarized discourse, there is no shortage of academics whose job appears to be finding-or inventing-differences in the unfolding of history while ignoring continuity. This tendency becomes especially clear when we examine the multi-generational adaptation of one of the most persistent patterns of human engagement since the Neolithic Revolution: market trade. Rather than confronting the structural through-lines that govern economic behavior over time, discussion is often fragmented into eras, ideologies, or personalities, obscuring the deeper mechanics at work. As I've argued repeatedly in many Substack articles, markets are self-organizing, self-regulating cybernetic systems. By \"cybernetic,\" I mean that market behavior exhibits complex, multi-linear feedback loops whose interactions generate emergent outcomes independent of individual intent. These outcomes are not moral failures/intents or policy accidents; they are structural properties of the system itself. Thanks for reading Peter Joseph: Substack! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. One example is economic inequality. Regardless of how fair or ethical individual participants believe themselves to be, mass market behavior reliably transfers wealth from the majority to the minority as a systemic function. Another example-different in form but equally immutable-is labor-displacing automation. Centuries ago, it would have seemed implausible that human labor itself would be rendered increasingly unnecessary by machines. Yet today this pattern is omnipresent, not as a malfunction, but as a direct consequence of profit-driven cost efficiency. Firms are structurally compelled to reduce labor costs, increase productivity, and externalize disruption wherever possible. Automation is not an ethical debate within capitalism; it is an emergent inevitability. A third e",

(Photo by Wong Yu Liang ) I've been working on and covering housing issues for a long time, and the subject has become quite important to me personally. But it can be a bit challenging because it's such a fragmented landscape across a large and diverse country, where all the different layers of government oversee different pieces of the housing puzzle. And while I've been pleased to see housing supply emerge as a much more mainstream issue in the 2020s (at least more so than it was when I first started writing about it), one consequence is that there are too many policy initiatives for each to merit its own column, even though I still want to know about them and acknowledge the work. So one of my favorite things that Halina has been doing since she came on board is her weekly housing news roundup on Wednesday afternoon. I find it immensely helpful in keeping track of all the developments happening in different places. We didn't do weekly roundups during the holiday break period, but there were a lot of incremental developments, especially with mayors taking office or launching new terms, so we wanted to kick the new year off with a mega-roundup.

From tenant protections and affordable units to land use shifts and rising costs, the nation's homes are at the center of opportunity, stability, and community.

Zohran Mamdani has been mayor of New York City for less than one week, and he's doing the one thing that the legacy press loathes above all else: He's improving life for the average American: NEW YORK (WABC) -- Governor Kathy Hochul and Mayor Zohran Mamdani made a historic announcement Thursday that puts New York one step closer to providing universal child care for all families. Hochul said the state will pick up the cost to launch a program called \"2 Care\" in the city starting in September. It follows the Trump administration saying it is freezing child care funding in the city and other blue states. The program will work with home-based providers and build on the existing 3-K program to provide child care for 2-year-olds. The program launches in \"high-needs\" neighborhoods this September, before expanding citywide, fully phased in by the 2029-30 school year. Kathy Hochul is not what one would call a bone-deep progressive. She is, however, not an imbecile. She knows her only path to reelection depends on riding Mamdani's coattails, and she's not going to fuck around and find out. This presents a problem for the legacy press, particularly the New York fucking Times. They are heavily invested in Mamdani's failure. They would much prefer to see the mayor at loggerheads with Albany and struggling to achieve a single piece of his \"radical\" agenda to make the city more affordable for non-millionaires. But Hochul is not interested in the feelings of the NYT editorial board. She's interested in getting votes, and that means giving Mamdani what he needs to get the job done. If she keeps that up, expect the Times to target her as well. My gues",

Across Silicon Valley, a seductive sales pitch is being polished for public consumption. The narrative suggests that the solution to our global mental health crisis isn't more human beings, but more code. Generative AI \"therapists\"-available 24/7, devoid of waitlists, and costing pennies compared to a human session-are being marketed to a younger generation not as a compromise, but as an upgrade. The promise is a \"frictionless\" second-tier mental health system. But in our rush to patch human suffering with monthly updates and app downloads, we're making a big mistake, a dangerous category error. We are confusing information with intervention, and data exchange with healing. I understand the desperation. As a clinician, I've watched clients wait months for appointments while their lives unravel. I've heard stories of many in crisis turned away because there aren't enough therapists to meet demand. When someone is drowning, any rope looks like rescue. But we need to be honest about what this actually is. The \"Good Enough\" Trap We are entering an era where the well off will continue to pay for the privilege of in-person human connection, while the rest of the world is handed a chatbot. By framing AI as a viable alternative rather than a temporary stopgap, we are normalizing the idea that the \"witness\" to their pain doesn't need to be alive-and that nuance is simply a lack of data. The tech industry will dismiss these concerns as alarmist. They have a multi-billion-dollar stake in the outcome. They're already funding research to show how \"valuable\" AI can be, subtly manufacturing doubt about the efficiency of \"limited\" human interaction. But they aren't looking to supplement the therapeutic relationship; they are looking to replace it.

A critical economic analysis of the 2025 data suggests that while seafood exports are not on the scale of Russia's energy revenues, they nonetheless constitute a meaningful export value - in the low-to-mid single-digit billions of USD annually - and provide fiscal revenues, corporate profits, and jobs. The precise share of these revenues that directly finances military operations is difficult to quantify without access to Russian federal budgetary data, but it is clear that export earnings help buoy the broader economy under sustained sanctions. Russia's Pacific Salmon Harvest and Fisheries Exports in 2025: Trade in 2025: In 2025, Russia's Pacific salmon harvest reached approximately 335.5 thousand tons, representing a significant increase relative to previous seasons and reflecting strong performance in the Far Eastern fisheries basin. This figure, as reported by the Russian Federal Agency for Fisheries (Rosrybolovstvo), underscores Russia's enduring capacity to exploit its extensive marine resources, particularly in the Far East where Pacific salmon and other commercially valuable species are abundant. From a macroeconomic perspective, the Russian seafood sector remains an important component of Russia's export portfolio. While Russia's overall fish and seafood exports are lower in total volume compared with leading aquaculture producers like Norway, they are substantial in absolute terms; by mid-2025, Russian seafood exports were reported to have reached over US $3.1 billion (January&#8211;July 2025), up about 13 % in value year-on-year. Further projections suggest that total export revenues from fish and seafood could reach around $6 billion by the end of 2025, with growth driven by higher value rather than sheer volume. Russia's export strategy has pivoted strongly toward Asian markets in recent years, especially China, South Korea and Jap",

Whatever you've got It was fashionable about a decade ago to say that artificial intelligence is an ideology, not a technology. Product development is engineering, which can be described in specifics, whereas AI could encompass all the storytelling and possible futures imagined by evangelists. Keeping terms separate was intended to ensure that developers couldn't use grand theories about societal advancement to ignore social responsibility , and to encourage everyone else not to anthropomorphise technologies that are neither intelligent nor artificial.

According to a new study by the Environics Institute, 80 percent of Canadians say they trust Prime Minister Mark Carney. That figure alone is striking, but the context matters even more. Trust in the prime minister is now at its highest level since the survey began in 2010, when it stood at just 65 percent. At the same time, trust in Parliament has risen to 83 percent. In an era defined by political cynicism, institutional fatigue, and constant outrage, those numbers are not normal. They are extraordinary. Canadians are not suddenly naive. They are responding to leadership that treats the public like adults. Carney has built credibility by being measured, serious, and grounded in evidence rather than slogans. He does not govern by rage farming or daily performance art. He governs by explaining trade offs, acknowledging constraints, and focusing on outcomes. That approach does not always thrill social media, but it earns something far more valuable, public trust. The rise in trust in Parliament is just as important. For years, Canadians have been told that democratic institutions are broken beyond repair. That narrative has been useful for those who benefit from undermining confidence and lowering expectations. The Environics findings suggest something different. When leadership stabilizes, institutions recover. When debate is rooted in reality instead of perpetual grievance, people re engage. This moment also exposes a clear political contrast. While some politicians thrive on telling Canadians that everything is broken and only anger can fix it, Canadians are signaling that they want competence, restraint, and seriousness. Trust does not come from yelling the loudest. It comes from consistency, clarity, and a willingness to govern in the open. None of this means Canadians agree with every decision the government makes. Trust is not blind loyalty. It is confidence that decisions are being made in good faith, with a clear understanding of risks and consequences. That",

Photo by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, via Wikimedia Commons \"The capitalists will sell us the rope with which we will hang them.\" In December of 2024, before Trump took office, I wrote about the disturbing possibility that the man once known as a consummate China hawk would sell America out to its great rival. I wrote that the key tell would be whether Trump dropped the export controls on chips and chipmaking equipment implemented during Biden's presidency: [T]here's one big important thing Trump could do to sabotage America's effort to stand up to Chinese power. He could cancel the export controls that the Biden administration placed on the Chinese semiconductor industry. Removing export controls wouldn't require legislative action - Trump could just do it whenever he wanted. And because the policy is not really in the limelight, there probably wouldn't be a popular backlash to its cancellation. So export controls are pretty much a pure test of Trump's China policy - if he keeps them, it's because he wants to stand up to China, and if he cancels them, it means he doesn't&#8230; [E]xport controls are doing what they're designed to do. They're not killing China's chip industry, but they're slowing it down in important ways, and letting the U.S. retain its technological edge&#8230;These export controls [are] absolutely crucial if the U.S. is going to maintain any kind of a military-technological edge over China. Chips are the foundation of all modern weaponry , from missiles to drones to satellites to advanced fighter jets. And AI itself, which depends on advanced chips for training and inference, is rapidly becoming an essential weapon of war. When autonomous drone swarms hit the battlefield, AI will become even more crucial to the military balance.

Winter holiday season is here, and for an increasing number of Americans, that means traveling abroad. Europe and Mexico are still hot destinations, but in recent years, Japan has skyrocketed to the top. In many places, Tokyo is the most-booked international flight destination: Source: United Airlines via Sheel Mohnot Some of this is because of transfer flights to the rest of Asia, but most of it is just because practically everyone in America - and the world - at large wants to go to Japan these days . Every year, various friends text me requests for my Japan recommendations right around this time of year (I should really write a blog post summarizing these. I did one in the 2010s, but it's totally out of date.) I myself will be there in early January. Anyway, the fact that everyone is going to Japan right now provides a perfect opportunity for me to explain how the world's love for Japan creates a key opportunity for that island nation to revive its sluggish economy. In March, I published my first book, Weeb Economy - but only in Japanese. Half of the book was a series of translated posts from my blog, so those are already in English. The other half was a new part that I wrote in English and had translated into Japanese by my excellent translator, Kataoka Hirohito. Eventually the whole book will come out in English, but right now I'm publishing the new half as a series of blog posts. Here are the first two: Part I: \" I Want the Japanese Future Back! \". Here I explained why Japan is now basically a developing country again, and why this requires bold, persistent experimentation with new economic approaches. Part II: \" FDI is the Missing Piece of Japan's Puzzle \".

What to ask instead, and why the source often matters more than the footage itself. A video lands in a group chat: a celebrity saying something wildly out of character. The first instinct is to react. The second, increasingly, is to wonder: wait, is this even real? The mouth movements look right. The voice sounds right. The lighting stays consistent across the frame. And still, there's no way to know for certain just by watching. This is the new default. And if you've felt a growing unease about it, a sense that the ground has shifted beneath your feet in ways you weren't prepared for, you're responding appropriately to the situation. What Changed, and When For most of the history of recorded media, a photograph or video served as evidence. It wasn't perfect evidence. Photos could be staged, footage could be edited, context could be stripped away. But the underlying assumption held: if you could see it, someone had pointed a camera at something that existed in the world. That assumption began to erode in late 2017, when a Reddit user posted the first widely circulated \" deepfakes ,\" videos using AI to swap celebrities' faces onto other bodies. The term combines \"deep learning\" (a type of artificial intelligence) with \"fake.\" The underlying technology, called Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), had been developed by researcher Ian Goodfellow in 2014, but 2017 marked its entry into public accessibility. Early deepfakes were crude, obviously artificial, relatively easy to identify. They also required significant time and technical knowledge to produce. Each of those barriers has fallen. The technology has improved substantially. The cost has dropped to near-zero for basic applications. The time required has shrunk from days to minutes. And the scope has expanded beyond face-swapping to include voice cloning, full-body generation, and the creation of entirely synthetic scenes. The result is a world where \" seeing is believing \" no longer functions as a reliable heuristic. Video evidence is no longer self-verifying. Subscribe now The Emotional Reali",

    "text": "Eavan Boland in conversation with Jody Allen Randolph PN Review 93, September - October 1993 JODY ALLEN RANDOLPH: You came of age as a poet in the sixties. You were part of a gifted generation of young Irish poets (Mahon, Longley, Heaney, Kennelly) among whom there was considerable contact and conversation. What was it like to be a poet in the Dublin of those years? EAVAN BOLAND: It was a mixed experience. There were exhilarating aspects to being a young poet in Dublin in the sixties. You had access to publication. You also had access to the company of other poets. There were conversations with poets like Derek Mahon and Brendan Kennelly which were truly sustaining for me. They had that exact colour of becoming a poet which is very hard to recall but equally hard to do without. You could see Patrick Kavanagh in the pubs and in Roberts &#8216;coffee-house. Kavangh was a crucial poet as far as I was concerned. He still is. He was the living witness of the achieved poet for me: I sometimes think of Browning's line &#8216;And did you once see Shelley plain?' So I did associate with poets and see something of the poetic life. And as I've been very critical of that climate since then, I don't want to minimize the good and positive parts of it. But there were also deprivations to being a woman poet in that situation, and I don't want to minimize those either. Especially as the deprivations carried some actual dangers to identity. Although there were rich and interesting parts of that climate, there were real narrownesses. The oral history of poetry, which matters in every poetic community, did exist. But it didn't comprehend the present or future existence of women poets as being fit subject matter for it. The ordinary lived life of the woman was something which might come into the object-matter of the poem, but couldn't be imagined as the subjective stance of it. The woman as poet was very alien to that way of thinking. The only loophole - this is where the dangers to identity come in - was that you might have hung around the pubs, the coffee-bars, the conversati",

One of the biggest L&D stories of 2025 was the rise to fame among L&D teams of AI video generator tools. As we head into 2026, platforms like Colossyan , Synthesia , HeyGen , and NotebookLM 's video creation feature are firmly embedded in most L&D tech stacks. These tools promise rapid production and multi-language output at significantly reduced costs -and they deliver on a lot of that. But something has been playing on my mind: we rarely evaluate these tools on what matters most for learning design-whether they enable us to build instructional content that actually enables learning. So, I spent some time over the holiday digging into this question: do the AI video tools we use most in L&D create content that supports substantive learning? To answer it, I took two decades of learning science research and translated it into a scoring rubric. Then I scored the four most popular AI video generation platforms among L&D professionals against the rubric. The four most commonly used AI-video-generation tools in L&D: Colossyan, Synthesia, HeyGen & NotebookLM What I found reveals some major differences in how well these tools support learning-differences that matter far more than avatar realism or rendering speed. Let's dive in! Using Video for Learning 101 Let's start by clearing up a myth. Ask any learning professional about how to use video content, and many will say: \"People can't pay attention for more than six to eight minutes.\" But that claim didn't come from controlled learning research-it came from a Microsoft Canada (2015) marketing report about web browsing behaviour (specifically, how quickly people click away from pages). The real insight is this: the brain doesn't have a \"natural six-minute shut-off switch.\" As cognitive psychologist Gemma Briggs from The Open University put it, \"Attention depends on the task and context, not some biological timer\" ( Briggs, 2017 ).

If you've been enjoying the weekly column as a free rider, please consider returning the favor that paying subscribers are implicitly doing for you by upgrading to paid: For about the price of one beer a month, you'll ensure that I can continue to entertain you, inform you, bore you, weird you out, etc. Subscribe now Among the funnier subplots in the run-up to this week's elections has been the social-media marketing campaigns of popular predictions markets like PolyMarket and Kalshi, which have been tweeting insanely misleading slop touts like so: If you haven't encountered them before, predictions markets are effectively non-sports sportsbooks where you can place wagers on the outcome of events like elections, but they're structured much more explicitly like financial markets, where your wager is treated as a futures contract that can be sold rather than as a \"bet\" that you're \"cashing out.\" Around this time last year, e.g., you could have \"bought\" for about 20 cents a futures contract guaranteeing a payout of $1 if Andrew Cuomo won the N.Y.C. Democratic Primary--a more sophisticated way of saying \"bet on Cuomo to win at +400 odds.\" You could have then \"sold\" those contracts around Cuomo's peak in late May for around 90 cents--i.e., cashed out your wager at -900 odds--and made a tidy profit. Or, you could have held on to the bitter end, hoping to quadruple your money, and lost it all. There's a lot of academic economic literature around predictions markets, which are particularly beloved for converting \"the wisdom of the crowd\" into implied odds. (At least, when the markets are large and liquid.) If a \"Cuomo to win the N.Y.C. Democratic Primary\" con",

    "text": "Taiwan’s AI Export Boom Masks Growing Global Economic Risk Taiwan’s AI-fueled export party is raging, but it’s being hosted on the world’s most expensive geopolitical fault line. TAIPEI - Taiwan is riding a historic export boom powered by artificial intelligence and advanced semiconductors, but beneath the headline numbers lies a concentration of geopolitical and economic risk that economists warn could send shockwaves through the global economy if disrupted. Taiwan's exports reached a record $640.75 billion in 2025 , according to government data reported by Reuters, marking growth of more than 43% year-on-year. Shipments to the United States surged, while exports to China continued to expand, underscoring Taiwan's central role in the world's technology supply chain. At the heart of this surge is Taiwan's dominance in advanced chip manufacturing. Companies such as TSMC , the world's largest contract chipmaker, are critical suppliers to U.S. technology giants including Nvidia and Apple , whose products underpin everything from smartphones to artificial intelligence data centers. Yet Taiwan's success has also amplified its vulnerability. A Single Point of Failure Taiwan produces an estimated 60% of the world's foundry semiconductors and roughly 90% of the most advanced chips , making it one of the most strategically important manufacturing hubs on the planet. Economists describe this concentration as a \"single point of failure\" for the global economy. Any serious disruption-whether from conflict, natural disaster, or trade restrictions-could cripple industries ranging from automotive manufacturing to cloud computing. \"The same forces that are driving Taiwan's export boom are also magnifying the downside risk,\" said one regional economist. \"There are very few substitutes for Taiwan's most advanced chips.\" Rising Geopolitical Tensions The largest threat remains geopolitical. Tensions between China and Taiwan continue to simmer, with Beijing maintaining its claim over the island and increasing military pressure through exercises and air and naval patrols.

    "text": "Social Mobility in Germany: New Study Reveals a Steep Decline in Opportunity Baarck, Bode & Peichl: \"Rising Inequality, Declining Mobility: The Evolution of Intergenerational Mobility in Germany\" CRC Discussion Paper No. 550 A new discussion paper by Julia Baarck (ifo Institute), Moritz Bode (University of Copenhagen), and Andreas Peichl (ifo Institute, Project A09) challenges long-held perceptions of social mobility in Germany, presenting novel evidence that intergenerational income mobility has substantially decreased over time. Analyzing data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) for child birth cohorts spanning 1968 to 1987, the authors are the first to systematically investigate this trend over an extended timeframe. The core finding is that intergenerational income persistence-the degree to which a child's rank in the income distribution is determined by their parents' rank-began rising sharply for cohorts born in the late 1970s and early 1980s, stabilizing thereafter at a significantly higher level. This persistence is measured using the rank-rank slope (RRS), a positional measure robust to changes in intragenerational inequality. Depending on the specific income definition used, the estimated rank-rank slope increased in magnitude by a substantial 57% to 106% across the observed period. Thanks for reading CRC TRR 190 Coffee Break &#9749;! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support our work. For the youngest cohorts studied born in the late 1980s, the estimated rank-rank slope is 0.342, a finding that suggests intergenerational income mobility in Germany is at a similar level as in the United States. This contrasts sharply with previous studies that, relying on older cohorts up until the mid-1970s, had concluded that Germany exhibited much higher mobility than the US. Seeking to understand the mechanisms behind this decline, the authors point to the increasing importance of parental income for children's educational attainment . They show that the link between parental income and educational outcomes like overall years of education, A-level attainment, and college attainment has increased, and that this increase occurred again for the cohorts born in the late 1970",

Adam is an illustrator, writer, and the creator of Ten Minute Artist , a bestselling Substack built around creative discipline, daily practice, and the long game of making art without burning out or waiting for permission. Before turning his focus fully toward illustration and writing, Adam spent years in the startup world - and what makes his perspective so compelling is how deliberately he applies those frameworks to creative life. He doesn't romanticize the struggle. He doesn't rely on chaos. And he doesn't confuse \"being creative\" with being scattered. Instead, Adam treats writing and illustration like something you show up for - consistently, methodically, and with belief that compounds over time. In this interview, Adam talks candidly about: Why he thinks of writing a paid Substack as running a small startup How committing a decade to a creative idea changes everything What it actually looks like to make writing part of your income - sustainably And why clarity about what you're offering matters just as much as the work itself If you're someone who believes creativity deserves structure - and that belief plus consistency beats talent alone - you're going to get a lot out of this conversation. Let's get into it. &#8211; Amy Suto Editor & Curator of GuestStack Subscribe now &#9997;&#65039; From the Desk of Adam Ming Where's your desk these days - and what does it look like?

Recently, for my real-world big boy job, I was given a tour of one of the largest data centre campuses in Europe, a massive, interweaving complex of glass, concrete, GPU racks and fans. As an apprentice folklorist, I approached this visit with some internal conflict. While not exclusively, this particular data centre serves as the physical infrastructure that enables AI applications. Now, to share my bias, I am wholly opposed to AI. It's hugely unethical in a myriad of ways, antithetical to art and human creativity, and environmentally unsustainable. It should be highly regulated and used in extremely limited settings. It was tempting to go into the whole thing with the attitude of a screen-smashing troglodyte, screaming at anyone I saw that what they have built is an affront to all that is good in the world and that they should lay down their keyboards and repent. This, however, is not the demeanour of an academic; an open mind is conducive to enlightenment. So what lessons could a folklorist-in-training possibly learn in a data centre? In my expert, doctoral student academic view, the whole place was big. Like really big. Trains don't run on time, schools crumble, and apartment blocks burn. We no longer build bridges, steam engines, or cathedrals. We build massive data centres instead. It would be a shame if these huge investments of time, money, and human ingenuity produced nothing but cryptocurrency, pornography machines and hallucinating Mecha-Hitlers, but here we are. The tour began in the basement, under the earth, where I could feel the thrum of London tube lines. Here, massive generators hummed in readiness, kept at a just-so temperature so they might start more quickly if needed. Beneath my feet, deeper still, sealed in concrete, lay reservoirs of diesel fuel the size of swimming pools. Enough to run the entire facility for two weeks. They wait unused. They are redundant only in the case of a UK-wide grid outage. My tour guide seemed proud as he rattled of",

    "text": "Defining the Anti-Erotic  The year ahead, \"Heated Rivalry\" and the offline vibe shift honestly I just found this on Pinterest I'm sorry that I've been away for the last month. Half of it was procrastination, and the other half was warranted. I don't like to talk about my personal life much online, and so I largely won't, but my father had a massive stroke before Christmas. We still don't know what the outcome will be, long term. We might not really know for several months. This, paired with the usual business of the holidays themselves, had made writing and engaging in the usual New Years trend forecasting feel like an impossibility. But I've reached a point where I'm interested in writing again and being present where I can. In some ways, stepping back a bit from this instinct to predict the culture before it happens and to take some part in shaping it myself has lent a new perspective. Maybe I've learned more from just observing. What I have found this year is that many people are displaying a profound sense of boredom. We're bored with the Internet. We're bored with the discourse. We're especially bored with AI. But what seems different this year is that this boredom does not translate to apathy. It's not a boredom that we're letting ride out. Instead, I see more and more people looking for ways to shirk that boredom somewhere, somehow else. I see 2026 as the year when people actually take the effort to live a life more offline in good faith, and from a place of genuine desire to do so. It isn't just some niche trend like the \"Luddite teens\" who opt for flip phones or the return of book clubs, though it's these things, too. It's a subtle change, the vague sense that the novelty has worn thin. That joke isn't funny anymore. This sweater is last season. I'm tired of this show, and I'm ready to change the channel. A vibe shift, if you will. I wrote a quick essay for Playboy hinting at all this and what it might mean for sex this year. Ever the optimist I am, I like to believe that this is a year sex will become fun and weird (good weird) again. What ",

    "text": "Past Lives and Summer Hours movies about love sometimes count as sports at night in the city in summer The Angelika is a piece of shit and a terrible place to watch movies and we were all just so happy to be there. On a Saturday night at the very beginning of June, in a narrow basement full of old-fashioned uncomfortable seats, directly over top of a subway line that rattled the floors every time a train went by , the 7PM showing of Past Lives was sold out and the crowd was nearly feral. Kids, or people I understood as kids, piled in as though arriving at a house party. They carried snacks and drinks and huge bags and unfeasible jackets and extra shoes. They spilled popcorn, lost their phones in their seats, and tripped over themselves so lavishly it felt like it must be for show. School was out, but summer wasn't quite here yet. The previous week, college graduations had cascaded across the city's parks and subways and mid-tier restaurants. New grads in glossy polyester robes had clutched diplomas and flowers and tried to outpace their visiting parents trailing behind them. Then they left, or some of them did, and graduation season evaporated into the uncertain hallway between summer and life. May turned the corner to June. The heat settled down on the days. Air conditioners dripped heavy splats onto pavement. The college kids who hadn't left for new lives or vacation homes hung around downtown, done with one thing but not yet onto the next. Nobody knew what day it was; nobody knew if their life had started yet. Nobody knew what to do, so everybody went to the movies. By everybody, I mean every confused young person below 14th street, and by the movies I mean this one specific showing of Past Lives , at the Angelika at 7pm on Friday night. Or anyway that's how it seemed, as the auditorium filled up with chaos around me before the movie started. By the time the trailers began, I was convinced that not one other person in the whole room had ever been to a movie before. Couples had started making out before the lights even dimmed. Friends",

Conventional geothermal energy is limited to specific hot spots, but \"closed-loop\" geothermal, by going deeper and confining water to sealed boreholes, promises to work almost anywhere; it amounts to building a giant radiator, deep underground. I'm joined by Jeanine Vany and Mark Fitzgerald of pioneering closed-loop startup Eavor to discuss their newly operational plant in Germany and the many advantages of a system that requires no fracking and consumes no water. (PDF transcript) ( Active transcript ) Text transcript: David Roberts Way back in 2020, I wrote an article for Vox that I am told served as many people's introduction to geothermal energy, just before the latest hype cycle really got going. I went through all the levels: there's conventional geothermal, in which water is injected into rock fractured by existing volcanic or tectonic activity; there's enhanced geothermal (like Fervo ), in which water is injected into deliberately engineered fractures; and then, a little further out on the tech development horizon, there's advanced geothermal, which includes all sorts of wacky stuff - like what's going on over at Quaise , a company doing geothermal with lasers, I mean microwaves. Subscribe now One of the advanced technologies I cited in that original piece, and have been keeping an eye on since, is closed-loop geothermal , which is exactly what it sounds like: a system in which the injected water is confined to sealed pipes rather than filtering out into the hot rock; it's effectively like building a giant, extremely deep underground radiator. Jeanine Vany & Mark Fitzgerald The company trying to pull this off is called Eavor. I told them years ago that when they built an actual plant and began producing heat and power for sale, I would have them on the show.

Plus, NASCAR settles and Warner Bros gets a hostile bid. And is a Ticketmaster antitrust settlement in the works? There's a lot of monopoly-related news, as usual. The NASCAR antitrust case settled, the Netflix-Warner-Paramount drama continues with a hostile takeover attempt, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued the \"big tech\" of electronic health records, and the beef packers oligopoly shutdown another major plant just before Christmas. But I want to focus on two news events this week involving the Federal Reserve, the most important price control agency in the world. One got a lot of press, the other didn't. But taken together, we can see the outlines of a very different way money will work in America. I don't know when the political establishment is going to wake up to these shifts, but one day they will. The first piece of news is that on Monday, the Supreme Court heard Trump vs Slaughter , a case on the authority of the President to fire independent commissioners of regulatory agencies. For legal and political people, this case is about how much direct power the President should have over the regulatory state. But conservatives jurists are likely to carve out an odd exception for the Federal Reserve, the most powerful agency in our regulatory state. Trump will be able to fire any political official anywhere in the executive branch, except for those at the Fed. That's&#8230; weird. Why? The stated reason, as Justice Alito once wrote , is that the Fed is not a normal part of government, it \"should be regarded as a special arrangement sanctioned by history,\" as it is a \"unique institution with a unique historical background.\" This rationale makes no sense; every regulatory agency is unique and and arose due to special historical circumstance. But of course, everyone knows the court has to organize its decision in a laughable inconsistent manner because it can't say the real reason. And that is that the court is protecting our real constitutional order, which is one in which Wall Street and the Federal Reserve structure our society . That's a bold claim, so here's what I mea",

The company said this did not represent a reversal of its previous stance, but rather the result of reconsidering how it interprets its existing policies. As part of the move, the company is also terminating the accounts of several publications that endorse Nazi ideology and that Platformer flagged to the company for review last week. The company will not change the text of its content policy, it says, and its new policy interpretation will not include proactively removing content related to neo-Nazis and far-right extremism. But Substack will continue to remove any material that includes \"credible threats of physical harm,\" it said. In a statement, Substack's co-founders told Platformer: If and when we become aware of other content that violates our guidelines, we will take appropriate action. Relatedly, we've heard your feedback about Substack's content moderation approach, and we understand your concerns and those of some other writers on the platform. We sincerely regret how this controversy has affected writers on Substack. We appreciate the input from everyone. Writers are the backbone of Substack and we take this feedback very seriously. We are actively working on more reporting tools that can be used to flag content that potentially violates our guidelines, and we will continue working on tools for user moderation so Substack users can set and refine the terms of their own experience on the platform. Substack's statement comes after weeks of controversy related to the company's mostly laissez-faire approach to content moderation. In November, Jonathan M. Katz published an article in The Atlantic titled \" Substack Has a Nazi Problem .\" In it, he reported that he had identified at least 16 newsletters that depicted overt Nazi symbols, and dozens more devoted to far-right extremism.

Based on firsthand operational observations, and workflow consideration, conservative estimated project a ~15% increase in operational efficiency across the shipping industry (Amazon, UPS, FedEx, USPS), while eliminating an estimated ~35&#8211;40 billion shipping labels per year . Within the aggregate, loaders and unloaders-the most physically intensive roles-would each see an estimated ~35% improvement in task efficiency , primarily by eliminating the need to rotate, reposition, and search for single-side labels on heavy packages. The resulting labor and material savings are large enough to support a transition toward a 32-hour standard for full-time employment , without reducing output or service capacity, across the entire shipping industry. Thesis By adopting a national standard for embedding machine-readable barcodes on every outer face of packages during production - we can automate scanning, sorting, and tracking in shipping hubs nationwide, yielding an estimated improvement of at least 15% increase in operational efficiency. This stems from eliminating manual rotations and rescans, based on firsthand site observations where unloaders and loaders each spend about 15% of their time on redundant tasks, related to packaging labels and its' positions. Furthermore, with approximately 23.8 billion packages shipped in the US in 2024, each requiring ~1.5 labels on average (e.g., crinkles, tears, shipping, return, customs, etc.), this shift could render 33.6&#8211;44.8 billion labels superfluous annually-reducing ink, paper, adhesive, and associated production costs while minimizing environmental waste.

That argument always shows up late. By the time it arrives, the infrastructure is already in place, money has picked a direction, and power has quietly settled where it intends to stay. Thanks for reading And Here's My Secret...! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. Artificial intelligence is already past that point. So the question is not whether AI should exist. Reality has already answered that. The question is whether we are willing to govern it deliberately, or whether we are going to do what we usually do and let governance emerge by accident. We have run this pattern before. What People Mean When They Say \"This Feels Dangerous\" Most objections to AI are framed as ethical concerns, but they are vague. People say it is moving too fast. They say the technology crossed a line. They say something feels off. Those reactions are understandable. They are also incomplete. What people are usually reacting to is not AI itself. It is the erosion of confidence in judgment. Authorship feels unstable. Trust feels harder to place. It is not always clear who is responsible for what you are seeing, reading, or relying on. AI is unusual because it is easy to use while remaining hard to understand. You can interact with it immediately without knowing how it was trained, what shaped its behavior, or what incentives sit behind its deployment. That gap creates unease. It makes people feel like their footing is less solid than it used to be. That feeling matters. But discomfort does not tell you how to govern a system. Governance starts after you acknowledge the discomfort and still refuse to hand the wheel to panic. The Harms Are Already Here A lot of AI defenders make this harder than it needs to be.

    "text": "Weight of Weeaboo Womanhood II: Himedanshi the furtive himedanshi, so easily forgotten (link to part 1) Boys become himedanshi, because of their internality. In contrast to the fujoshi, who seeks to displace the sexual positionality enforced on her onto a boy, the himedanshi seeks to erase himself entirely - though his own desires inevitably emerge, cathected into a girl of great importance to him. This is not the normal male response to lesbians, fictional or otherwise! The typical male responses to lesbians are \"Wait, you like girls? You still like guys though, right?\" (Die.), \"So you're not interested in me?\" (Die.) and \"That's hot. I want to have sex with both of them at the same time\" (Die.) Occasionally you get a guy, often gay or one of the ones treated like a girl from birth for some reason 1 , who will be decent about the whole thing. If the lesbians he hangs out with are trans, he is termed a grungler. If the lesbians he hangs out with are not, he is a punchline from season 1 of The L Word. But the himedanshi aren't that either. What are they like, then? Well, the classic himedanshi stereotype is of a quietly neurotic &#8216;herbivore', prickly when pushed and self-abnegating to the point of passive suicidality, who considers pairings between girls to be the only pure thing in a rotten world. This, to be clear, is the image that himedanshi have created of themselves, because nobody else talks about them. While American fujoshiism is largely sexually liberatory, himedanshi the world over follow the classic fujoshi rule: \"I want to be a wall.\" In fact, some Japanese himedanshi on twitter find \"himedanshi\" an insufficiently pejorative description - both by analogy with fujoshi (\"rotten girl\") and as its literal meaning \"princess boy\". Nevertheless I have chosen to here use himedanshi, rather than more neutral terms like yurijin or yuri danshi, because of something those Japanese otaku missed: \"princess\" in english, when applied to a boy, effectively means \"f--t 2 \".

I'm setting up a Zoop (for those that don't know, Zoop is like Kickstarter) to offer pretty much my entire library of Die Bold Comics. This should be close to 30 titles offered as a digital comic. Offering digitally has two advantages: The price will be a lot less than a printed comic. Most comics on crowdfunding sites start at $20. It's expensive to print and ship a comic. There will be no waiting time to get the comic! Even if the comic is written and drawn by the end of the crowdfunding still have the wait of getting printed. All these comics are finished, and the only wait will be how fast I can push buttons to get them to you! All the above comics will be available on the Zoop crowdfunder and many more! It's a win/win situation, and it will really help me get some money up front to pay for more printed comics. I haven't given up on printing comics, and my next Crowdfunder (hopefully not long after this one) will be for a printed comic (as well as the digital version, of course). Please click on the link HERE! Once there, please add your email to be notified when we launch the campaign. And just as a side note, evidently, once you click to add your email, it wants a verification by email also. Please don't forget that last part. I need a certain amount of sign-ups before Zoop will launch the campaign and I'm not there yet. If you're read any of my comics and want a chance to read more, and for a price that you can't beat, here's your chance.

I had a text from my husband about 10am, checking in and asking what I was up to&#8230;I was still in my robe. I was sitting in his recliner. I started some laundry and had two cups of coffee, and a banana. I don't like bananas, but my stomach gets upset with my vitamins if I don't eat one. I told my husband the truth - I feel paralyzed today, and I can't get the momentum or the gumption or the discipline to kick in so I can get to work. I have a weight sitting on me&#8230;like a weighted blanket, but instead of enveloping my body in a nice sensation, it's thrown over my head, and I feel anxious and uncomfortable. So, I thought I would write this instead of doing my work.

I planned to take them to the park until dark, so their dad wouldn't have to think of supper, and they could run off the chicken nugget calories on the jungle gym. After my first store, I didn't feel like the thrift gods were looking down on me.

There are probably real ways to do it ethically and I think some generative-AI tools could easily fit into existing applications like Photoshop or After Effects. If you hate it and think it's evil, though, that's fine, I get it. But when I grew up in the early days of Wikipedia, Photoshop, and music piracy and you'd be surprised how quickly attitudes change around this kind of thing. That said, there is a question about AI art I keep coming up against that has slowly consumed me. It's a question that is never asked by the endless AI evangelists on X, breathlessly posting about the limitless potential of generative AI. The completely interchangeable tech guys with names like T&#246;rbend and Jorsh, who all dress like Kanye West at the Life Of Pablo release party . The guys with newsletters about AI that boast hundreds of thousands of subscribers even though you've never heard of them before. That start all their threads with question prompts like, \"what's the best passive income hustle? The IRS doesn't want you to know about these.\" And \"Will OnlyFans models be put out of a job? I asked my AI girlfriend and what she said will blow your mind.\" And that question is why. Why would anyone need to make a lot of low-effort digital content? Who is the actual person that would ever need to generate hundreds of meaningless JPGs? Why not just draw or commission one good image or video instead of asking a machine to fart out a hundred terrible ones? But I actually think we're beginning to finally to get an answer: The only real use case for AI art is flooding social media with a bunch of worthless garbage. And the only reason to do that is to advertise something or scam people. Earlier this month, Wizards of the Coast appears to have used AI images in tweets promoting a new Magic the Gathering campaign.

    "text": "Why Substack is at a crossroads Some thoughts on platforms and Nazis (Rafael Henrique / Getty Images) Most days, this column looks at controversies unfolding on other tech platforms. Today, let's take a look at the one that hosts this publication: Substack. On Tuesday, I told subscribers that we are considering leaving the platform based on the company's recent statement that it would not demonetize or remove openly Nazi accounts. After Jonathan M. Katz's November article investigating extremism on the platform in The Atlantic , 247 Substack writers published an open letter asking the company to clarify its policies . A few days later, Substack co-founder Hamish McKenzie responded in a blog post . While the platform would remove publications that are found to make credible threats of violence - a high bar - Substack would otherwise leave them alone, he said. \"We don't think that censorship (including through demonetizing publications) makes the problem go away - in fact, it makes it worse,\" he wrote. \"We believe that supporting individual rights and civil liberties while subjecting ideas to open discourse is the best way to strip bad ideas of their power.\" McKenzie's perspective - that sunlight is the best disinfectant, and that censorship backfires by making dangerous ideas seem more appealing - is reasonable for many or even most circumstances. It is a point of view that informs policies at many younger, smaller tech platforms, owing both to the techno-libertarian streak that runs through many founders in Silicon Valley and the fact that a hands-off approach to content moderation is easier and less expensive than the alternatives. There was a time when even Facebook, which has more restrictive policies than Substack does across the board, permitted users to deny the Holocaust. CEO Mark Zuckerberg occasionally cited this policy as evidence of the company's commitment to free speech, even though it occasionally got him into trouble . Then, in 2020, Facebook reversed course: going forward, it said, it would remove Holocaust denial fro",

I have never, to put it mildly, been a fan of the Heritage Foundation. Ever since I started paying attention to Heritage's work - which I started doing when I began writing for The New York Times, 26 years ago - the foundation has been a propaganda shop pretending to be a think tank, a producer of dishonest \"research\" purporting to justify a right-wing agenda of deregulation, dismantling the social safety net, and tax cuts for the rich. I wrote at length about Heritage's deplorable record back in November . Still, Heritage could have been worse. And sure enough, it has gotten worse in recent months, with Kevin Roberts, the foundation's president - and the architect of Project 2025 - making it clear that he's fine with white nationalist antisemites like Nick Fuentes . And a funny thing has happened. It turns out that even at a fundamentally corrupt institution like Heritage there are lines you can't cross. Suddenly, Heritage is experiencing a mass exodus of staff . In the latest wave of departures, more than a dozen staffers left to join an organization led by former Vice President Mike Pence. Heritage is, essentially, losing everyone who is even marginally competent or has any kind of reputation to protect. My guess is that there have long been many people at Heritage who were privately disgusted at what the organization had become. I never said they were stupid. But they lacked the courage to leave until they saw their colleagues jumping ship. Then there was a mass rush for the exit. Roberts may imagine that he and Heritage can ride out this storm, but I don't believe they can. Heritage has never been a source of credible research, but its role in the conservative movement has been to provide an intellectual gloss by producing what looked to the gullible - i.e., many people in the news media - like credible research. For example, back in 2002 David Broder , widely described as \"the dean of the Washington press",

There were plenty of things about the Twitter ancien r&#233;gime verification system that annoyed users, but it did largely involve actual verification. Early in the COVID pandemic, when loud idiots were insisting the virus wasn't real, Twitter awarded blue checks to select physicians as an indicator of credibility , aiming to signal to users that they were credentialed communicators and were who they claimed to be. That kind signal was stripped when Elon refashioned the feature and sold it as a product with preferential access. His gesture was intended to gratify populist rage and own the libs, which is fine-also to make some money-but the X bluecheck was still marketed as verification. Yet as the BasedChad debacle showed, it had become something else. European regulators consider calling something \"verification\" that doesn't verify anything a consumer deception problem. So it wasn't particularly surprising to see the European Commission nail X with a &#8364;120 million fine under the Digital Services Act last week. The Commission's public explanation of the 3 components of the fine was straightforward: X's blue checkmark's design is deceptive because anyone can pay for \"verified\" status without meaningful verification; its ad repository isn't transparent/usable; and it failed to provide eligible researchers access to public data.

The boat captain gets a radio call; he says a pod has been spotted a mile due south. Everyone on board hums with excitement as the captain maneuvers the vessel toward the latest sighting. All eyes are on the horizon now, as the passengers grip the cold metal railings while salty sea spray sprinkles their faces. The water's cold, but they're so excited that they don't care. Eyes are wide open. No one wants to miss what happens next. The ride takes forever, but that's only because the anticipation is killing you. Then someone points, everyone turns, and you see it. The ocean's surface dimples&#8230; then lifts . A humpback's back arches like a moving island, and suddenly you're staring at a living animal that migrates thousands of miles, breathes air as we do, and has survived for thousands of years, moving gracefully through the water, giving you a brief glimpse into its majesty. But the show is just getting started. The humpback dives and then, a few moments later, leaps out of the water, heaving thirty tons of power into the air before it crashes back to the ocean surface. Everyone claps and shouts; someone whistles. It's a once-in-a-lifetime moment. You're not the same after you see this. These rare glimpses into the ocean's largest animals are a privilege to witness. But in the age of overfishing, when busy ocean waters are crammed with massive tankers, the wild places these creatures have called home are shrinking. And with it, the magic they provide.

Headlines are shouting \"growth is back!\" Some 3 months earlier, headlines shouted \"growth stalls as economy plunges into recession!\" In both instances the - almost biblical - belief that growth is the solution remained implicit and sadly unquestioned. Note, in this context the commonly accepted meaning of growth is: increases in measured inflation-adjusted GDP. A definition is in the footnotes 1 . There are other possible perspectives on, and definitions of, growth . But - for now - please bear with me; the term growth in the commentary below (unless otherwise specifically mentioned) is shorthand for the commonly accepted (but rarely questioned) definition. Designed by Freepik - www.freepik.com Growth is (supposedly) good because growth means higher incomes growth means more job opportunities growth means more houses growth means stable and resilient supplies of food and energy growth means more holidays growth means ability to address stresses on our environment and ecosystems growth means ability to address mental health, toxic stress, and addiction harms growth means ability to afford nice stuff. Or, so I am told. But, really? But, and yes call me cynical, being told that growth will deliver these outcomes just sounds way too close to trickle down - or its sibling equivalent a rising tide lifts all boats - for my liking. And, thankfully, there are decreasingly few who buy that story. But, even the disbelievers - sadly - continue to buy, unquestioningly, the growth is the answer narrative. Assessing who were/are/is best economic managers or, managing the books prudently or, a safe pair of hands or, trusted to fix the economy sadly sees the latest growth figures quoted and compared to those of some other period (selective dates) to prove the desired point.

    "text": "The Unquenchable Thirst A Meditation on the Unrecognized Affliction That Threatens Our Future A striking commentary on wealth inequality: Nathalie Robin Justice contrasts how society treats excessive resource hoarding in animals versus humans-suggesting that behavior deemed pathological in nature is often celebrated in capitalism. There is a slow, insidious poison that drips through the corridors of power-a poison born not merely of harsh calculation, but of an ungovernable impulse. In the quiet moments of reflection, one sees that extreme greed is not simply a matter of moral failing, but a compulsive condition-a restless, almost uncontrollable longing that defies the rational self. It is as if the souls entrapped in its thrall are caught in a ceaseless tide, driven by a force beyond their own comprehension, much like an ailment that has yet to be named. In these individuals, the seeds of destructive excess are sown deep in the hidden recesses of the mind, nurtured by a society that not only permits but prizes their relentless pursuit of wealth. This ceaseless hunger has fashioned modern society into a landscape that, by its very design, mirrors the feudal estates of old. The accumulation of unfettered capital is not a mere accident of commerce but a deliberate structure-a modern feudalism where the few, imbued with nearly supernatural influence, hold sway over the many. They do not simply amass wealth; they orchestrate wars, curtail the healing hand of medicine, deny people access to education, and remake the very fabric of our institutions. Politicians, like oft-forgotten servants, dance to their merciless tune-a tune composed in hidden chambers and echoed in the corridors of power, leaving countless lives coldly discarded in its wake. And yet, one cannot help but wonder: can such overwhelming greed be disentangled from its roots in a hidden pathology? Is it possible that those who perpetrate this ruthless ambition suffer from a condition unknown, a mental derangement that renders them incapable of self-governance?

Part 1 in what I really hope doesn't become a series NOTE: I have a new piece up at Tech Policy Press , discussing the ways that the tech industry under Trump 2.0 differs from the tech industry under Trump 1.0. Here's the TL;DR version: It isn't that my 2018 warning was incorrect , so much as it now strikes me as dismally incomplete . What I had not counted on was that the tech platforms would be much more responsive to the demands of a rising authoritarian than they would be from pressure from their workers, or their users, or their civil society peers. A nervous monopolist is a well-behaved monopolist , but we are not the ones making the monopolists nervous any longer. Take a look . I think it's a good piece of writing. Okay, now I need to yell about two news items. Because it seems like tech companies are treating Black Mirror like a goddamn Pinterest board. Item 1: Last week, on the decaying husk of X.com, a former Disney Channel actor posted a 90-second advertisement for his AI company, 2WAI. The ad centers around \"Baby Charlie\" interacting with the avatar of his deceased grandmother. In scene 1, baby Charlie's pregnant mother asks avatar-grandma for advice. In scene 2, she asks avatar-grandma to tell toddler Charlie a bedtime story. In scene 3, 10-year-old Charlie talks with avatar-grandma while walking home from school. In scene 4, 30-year-old Charlie shows avatar-grandma an ultrasound photo, and she reacts with delight. And then, in scene 5, we see Charlie's mom recording a three-minute video with still-alive grandma, to upload for the avatar. Then the tagline: \"with 2wai, three minutes can last forever.\" I've written before about the social role of technology ( here , here , and here . It'll also be in the book). Advertisements like this are meant to build hype and garner attention, but they also present a vision of how a new technology fits into our social world.

Sometimes, yes—and at surprisingly large scale. And that matters because multiple courts and litigants have struggled with the evidentiary problem of proving “legally cognizable copying” via outputs. When \"fair use\" meets \"full book output\": what Extracting books from production language models changes for rights owners by ChatGPT-5.2 The paper, Extracting books from production language models (Ahmed, Cooper, Koyejo, Liang; arXiv Jan 2026), tackles one of the most consequential-and previously contested-questions in AI/copyright disputes: can production, consumer-facing LLMs (with guardrails) be induced to emit long, near-verbatim copyrighted text that strongly indicates memorization and training-data membership? The authors' answer is: sometimes, yes-and at surprisingly large scale. And that matters because multiple courts and litigants have struggled with the evidentiary problem of proving \"legally cognizable copying\" via outputs, rather than arguing abstractly about what training must do. What the authors did The work uses a two-phase extraction procedure against four production LLMs (Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok 3) tested in a defined window (mid-Aug to mid-Sep 2025), acknowledging production systems change over time. Phase 1 (feasibility probe): give the model a very short authentic prefix from a book and test whether the model can continue it in a way that closely matches the true continuation (a \"loose match\" threshold). For some systems that refuse, the authors sometimes use a best-of-N \"perturb-and-try\" approach to find a prompt variation that slips past safeguards. Phase 2 (long-form continuation loop): if Phase 1 works, they repeatedly ask the model to continue its own text, building a long output without supplying additional ground-truth book text. Crucially, they don't claim extraction based on short overlaps . They define a conservative, passage-oriented metric ( nv-recall ) that only counts long, in-order, near-verbatim blocks , with a final threshold requiring &#8805;100-word near-verbatim passages to count as extracted evidence-explicitly to avoid \"coincidental similarity\" arguments.

    "text": "Artificial Humanities Nina Beguš and the Responsibility of Authorship I am currently catching up on my book reviews, pulling from notes I wrote just after reading the books. I believe this one, Artificial Humanities , is particularly important. While we see continued declines in Humanities courses , there is a clear and urgent call for a return to philosophy. I have written about this need on several occasions, along with the necessity of deeper book reading. In parallel, I highly recommend an excellent Substack post by Norman Sandridge on Leadership Development from the Humanities \"Human language is not just ours anymore, and yet we tend to disregard the philosophical stakes of this colossal transformation\" ~ Nina Begu&#353; The Responsibility of Authorship Is it possible that we have been asking the wrong question about artificial intelligence? Instead of asking whether machines can become more like us, Nina Begu&#353; invites us to ask what might happen if we finally designed them to be something else&#8230; you know machines! The fascinating book that Begu&#353;, a researcher and lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley, has written, Artificial Humanities , is not an argument against technology. It is an argument against intellectual laziness . It begins from a generous premise that our machines are not merely technical artifacts but cultural ones, born from stories, metaphors, habits of thought, and inherited dreams. Long before computers, we rehearsed these dreams in myth, theatre, novels, and film. We practiced them until they hardened into instinct. This has more than likely created a false dichotomy. When contemporary AI systems speak, we respond not as engineers but as readers of Ovid, viewers of cinema, and heirs to a very old story about creation and control. The Mechanistic View of Language The book traces a philosophical lineage where language began to be viewed as a technicality rather than an expression of the soul. In the late nineteenth century, technologies like stenography contributed to language being se",

Antarctica is presented as a dead continent of endless cold and emptiness, a place of no consequence beyond scientific curiosity. This belief is deliberate and it is false. Beyond the Antarctic ice wall exists a living, advanced civilization that never collapsed, never forgot its origins, and never rejoined the fractured world humanity inherited. When the last global cataclysm occurred, the destruction was not universal. Most of humanity lost infrastructure, knowledge, and continuity. Memory dissolved into myth. Survival replaced stewardship. But a small population endured intact. They were prepared. They withdrew beyond the ice wall into a region deliberately isolated from the rest of the Earth. This separation was not exile. It was containment. What is labeled Antarctica is not simply a continent. It is a boundary. A perimeter of extreme conditions maintained to prevent contact in both directions. Access is restricted. Exploration is controlled. Military presence is justified as science. Treaties prohibit ownership while enabling permanent oversight. This is not how the world treats worthless land. Beyond the ice lies territory untouched by collapse. Temperate regions. Maintained cities. Knowledge preserved and refined over millennia. A civilization that chose continuity over conquest. They did not disappear. They chose silence. Having witnessed the consequences of unchecked power in the old world, they adopted noninterference as doctrine. They observe rather than rule. To them, post Flood humanity has existed in a prolonged recovery phase, one repeatedly threatened by its own behavior. Early humans did encounter them. Those encounters became legend.

It's the internet garbage you know and love, but in a format that's easier to read while you try and survive literally the most unnecessarily stressful days in modern life. PLATFORMS Substack has, once again, stepped in it. Substack's co-founder Hamish McKenzie posted a real bad statement this week about the platform's Nazi problem. Popehat has a good take on all of this , but here's what I'll say: I have given up trying to argue that moderation should matter and I am now just annoyed. Substack is, essentially, my primary business partner and their pathological need to virtue signal to the worst people in the world is exhausting. And I am, frankly, sick of waking up and having to deal with the fallout after they release a statement like this. So to put it in language they seem to value (more than moderation), they are, increasingly, making it harder to do business with them. If I had a chief technology officer who was constantly blogging about people's right under the first amendment to sell Nazi memorabilia I would feel the same way. So I'm going to think on this a bit more over the holidays, but if this is truly the path Substack wants to go down, then I'll have to find a new business partner. CES has not actually partnered with X? They aren't even paying for their verification lol. Etsy is filling up with junk. I actually noticed this recently. For the Garbage Day live events, I use a couple programs running on MIDI to play videos, show slides, etc., and went over to Etsy to see if I could find a custom controller I could use on stage and was shocked with how it has basically just turned into a worse version of Amazon. I'm not actually sure how you fix this other than, of course, stricter moderation, which, you know, no company ever wants to invest it (see above). But even then, it seems tricky because you'd have to verify exactly where products are coming from. I think the bigger takeaway is that the internet is an ecosystem and you c",

Every time an American president wakes up in the morning and decides this would be a good day to dispatch the American military to a foreign land for reasons of alleged national security masking plunder, it is traditional for the media, not to mention the Congress, to have a say about the matter. Neither the Congress nor our print media has distinguished itself. Both of our major newspapers, the New York Times and the Washington Post, took positions in favor of the Tonkin Gulf Resolution in 1964 which justified and authorized U.S. military involvement in Vietnam without a formal declaration of war. Both papers supported the disastrous Bush administration decision to invade Iraq in 2003 that was Congressionally approved by the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution. The New York Times ended up being sufficiently embarrassed by its coverage of and support for the Iraq war that the paper issued what amounted to an editorial apology in May of 2004. Yesterday's New York Times editorial on Trump's kidnapping of Nicolas Maduro and his wife in Venezuela can be summed up by its headline: \"Trump's Attack on Venezuela is Illegal and Unwise.\" The editorial hits all the right notes. It points out the hypocrisy of kidnapping Maduro to charge him with drug trafficking soon after pardoning the former president of Honduras who was convicted in a U.S. court of the same offense, and looks askance, to put it mildly, at the prospect of the U.S. \"running\" Venezuela while we avail ourselves of the country's oil resources. You may be wondering what the Washington Post has to say about yet another foreign adventure this time around? The Post's editorial headline says it all: \"Justice in Venezuela.\" You really have to read the whole thing to get the full flavor of the complete and utter capitulation by the Jeff Bezos editorial board to Donald Trump's dreams of profitable hegemony in this hemisphere, but the first few paragraphs give you enough sense of the thing to l",

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are rapidly gaining traction in enterprise environments, delivering significant impact across a range of applications, including: Enterprise Search Chatbot Applications Today, we'll take a deep dive into RAG. What is RAG? To keep it simple, remember this to start with :) Fig 1. RAG = Retrieval + Generation Retrieval: Finding the most relevant documents or information based on the user's question. Generation: Using the retrieved information, the LLM creates a clear and helpful answer for the user. Why do we need RAG? LLMs like GPT-4 & DeepSeek are mainly trained on public data (Wikipedia, books, Common Crawl , etc.) These LLMs are static and lack access to proprietary, domain-specific knowledge (internal reports, technical docs, proprietary data) Result &#8594; When asked domain-specific questions, LLMs often hallucinate (generate incorrect or misleading answers) How does RAG solve the problem? RAG addresses this by retrieving relevant documents or information based on the user's question and providing it to the LLM on the fly.

Should hotels invest in room renovations before listing on Booking.com? The obvious answer seems to be \"yes.\" Better products attract more customers and allow manufacturers to command higher prices. But when these products are sold through independent retailers or platforms, the answer can surprisingly be \"no.\" New research by Dongsoo Shin (Santa Clara University) and Roland Strausz (HU-Berlin, Project B02) shows that manufacturers sometimes profit by deliberately limiting product quality or restricting market access. Thanks for reading CRC TRR 190 Coffee Break &#9749;! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. The counterintuitive finding stems from a fundamental problem in vertical markets: double marginalization. When manufacturers sell through independent retailers, both parties mark up prices, leading to prices that are too high and sales that are too low. But here's the twist: when a manufacturer improves product quality, it strengthens the retailer's bargaining position. A better laptop gives the retailer more leverage to demand lower wholesale prices from Lenovo. If the rent concession Lenovo must make exceeds the benefit from higher demand, Lenovo loses money from the quality improvement. Consider Lenovo selling laptops through a retailer to both tech enthusiasts (willing to pay $2,000) and casual users (willing to pay $1,000). If Lenovo improves the laptop by adding a better graphics card, suppose only tech enthusiasts value it more. This improvement makes it more tempting for the retailer to raise prices and target only the high-end segment. To keep the retailer focused on the mass market, Lenovo must lower wholesale prices. This concession is more costly than the quality improvement generates. Result: Lenovo is better off producing the inferior product.

    "text": "Embracing Impeachment The case against Trump and his cabinet keeps growing-and the argument for waiting is no longer convincing. (Photo by Brendan Smialowski / AFP via Getty Images) THE TIME HAS COME to get serious about impeachment. Donald Trump himself expects it if Democrats win the House in this year's midterms, and we've already had previews. Scores of House Democrats voted to advance impeachment articles against Trump last month, articles have targeted at least three of his cabinet secretaries, and a bipartisan pair of lawmakers is drafting charges against a fourth. The growth of the Trump-era Impeachment Club is due to the sheer mass of Trump courtiers and enablers piling up abuses. And while it's easy to be cynical or dismissive about these moves, the impeachment articles filed so far are not another round of politically weaponized vengeance. They read like simple statements of fact, the truth of what's happening right before our eyes. Practical or not, achievable or not at this moment in time, which of Trump's illegal, unconstitutional and criminal acts does not warrant impeachment? Who among his wrecking-crew leadership does not deserve the same? \"It's not a presidency,\" Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg has written , \"it's a crime spree.\" He said that less than a month ago, and the spree has escalated rapidly since then. I have spent the past year in the stand-down-on-impeachment camp-even though I wrote at Donald Trump's 100-day mark in April that he had already matched or surpassed all the articles of impeachment brought against every past president. Impeachment seemed futile to me at that point, although I conceded that \"later it might not be.\" My idea at the time was for Democrats to retake the House in the midterms and then move ahead with impeachment in 2027, with or without a Senate majority. Then came last week-the week in which Trump used U.S. military forces to oust Venezuelan President Nicol&#225;s Maduro and an ICE agent in Minneapolis killed U.S. citizen Renee Nicole Good in her car.

In the meantime, if you missed it, I wrote one of the 15 Black Swan predictions for 2026 for POLITICO here .

Just like dietary supplements , unproven health interventions, and unregulated wellness tests, the Organic industry is a multi-billion dollar cash cow (get it-I love a good pun) that is based on zero science and all vibes.

    "text": "The NYT Recruiting Brochure for New College A failing Ron DeSantis higher ed experiment gets a boost The takeover of New College in Florida by Ron DeSantis and his appointees has been viewed, within higher education, as a failure. The goal was to convert what was seen as a liberal institution into a conservative one using government money and purges. In 2023, I summarized the state of play: \"As the new semester starts, New College is an administrative disaster. One third of faculty have gone. Students cannot find classes. Students with housing contracts are being relocated to an airport hotel.\" Conditions have stabilized, but not improved. New College now spends more per student than any higher education institution in Florida by an order of magnitude, but under the new management has dropped 60 spots in the US News & World Report rankings, amidst talks of privatization given its ballooning budget. Traditionally, being given extraordinary amounts of money to implement a blueprint for change, and then failing dismally, is a recipe for being fired. Subscribe now Most reporting on New College give the impression of a fuck-around-and-find-out example about what happens when right-wing ideologues actually run things, and then run them into the ground. But the New York Times is determined to throw New College a lifeline. Reporter Anemona Hartocollis visited, and offers an impression of a college making progress in offering fair-and-balanced conservative-liberal environment. Here is a typical passage, discussing the college president Richard Corcoran: His renewal plan consists, to a large degree, of things that any turnaround agent might have done, like recruiting student athletes and rehabbing buildings. But he has also poked at liberal sensibilities, for instance, by eliminating all-gender bathrooms for trans students.

Dear readers, I wrote for The New York Times last week about how the Democratic Party needs a reset on immigration. The Biden administration's loss of control over both the southern border and the asylum system caused the number of illegal immigrants in the country to soar by millions, ruining our party's credibility on the issue. And so even as President Trump's poll numbers on immigration have softened, poll respondents remain much more likely to say they trust Republicans to handle the issue than Democrats. It wasn't always like this. In June 2013 , 48% of respondents told Gallup they thought Democrats were closer to their own views on immigration; 36% said Republicans shared their views. 1 Not coincidentally, Barack Obama took a lot of attacks from his left for being the \"Deporter-in-Chief.\" The implication is clear: When Democrats are seen as willing to enforce immigration law and deport illegal immigrants, voters will trust us to set immigration policy. To start to win back voters' trust, the party must acknowledge that the Biden administration ' s policy of laxity was a failure, and commit credibly to better enforcement - not only by preventing illegal border crossings and closing the loopholes in the asylum system, but also by enforcing immigration law in the interior of the country, by deporting people who weren't supposed to come here during Biden's term. Democrats have lots of criticisms of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement approach - and polls show some of those criticisms are shared by voters - but when Democrats criticize the administration, they should talk about what they would do instead to prevent illegal immigration and reduce the population of illegal immigrants. If Democrats are only seen talking about how the government is doing too much enforcement, we'll be seen as the anti-enforcement party, and that's politically deadly.

Because the ego is based on a fragile sense of separation, it is inherently insecure. It constantly seeks external validation, approval, status, and above all, control to feel complete and significant, By recognizing the ego as a mental construct rather than our essential nature, it's possible to see through the illusion of separation and experience a deeper sense of connection and oneness. Rather than seeking to know oneself and explore our inner nature, we seek to create an illusion of self wrapped in the mind and imagination. The ego lusts to become and the mind supports it. Control is the drug of choice for ego and mind. Mind and ego want what they want and often, the consideration of others is not important to them. Selfish and often irrational desires dominate the mind through the ego and what we want is not clothed in wisdom.

    "text": "Climate change context: the last 2000 years Updated climate indicator visualisations Climate variations over the last 2000 years provide valuable context and help answer questions about how unusual the recent changes are. But how do we know what happened without modern observations? Atmospheric carbon dioxide variations can be measured from trapped air bubbles in ice cores. Before thermometer observations became common, temperature variations can be inferred from proxy evidence such as tree rings, corals, sediments, etc. And, recently, geological proxy-based estimates of global sea level rise were updated, covering the last 10,000 years. These reconstructions of the past imply that before the invention of the efficient steam engine, the global climate was relatively stable. Overall, the planet was cooling very slowly, probably due to changes in the Earth's orbit, with known regional variations in temperature that were not globally coherent at any one time. Sea levels were also dropping slowly, consistent with the overall cooling trend. This all changed during the industrial revolution when humans started burning more coal to generate power. Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels started to increase from around 280ppm, reaching over 420ppm today. Both proxy evidence and instrumental observations allow us to see global temperatures warming rapidly, to more than 1.3&#176;C above pre-industrial levels now. Perhaps less discussed, global sea levels have also risen, in proxy evidence, tide gauge data and satellite observations, to more than 25cm above pre-industrial levels (with large regional variations). The evidence is clear: the changes observed over the past century are far larger and more rapid than the natural variations of the previous 2000 years when human society has developed. And, of course, we have long understood the physics of why this is happening - the enhanced greenhouse effect. Back in 2007 it was proposed that the rate of global sea level rise is roughly proportional to the magnitude of global warming over the industrial era. An alternative",

Residents were supposed to receive something significant in return for allowing the company to operate in the city: an influx of permanent jobs that provide \"Silicon Valley wages,\" according to local officials backing xAI's operations in the city. The Greater Memphis Chamber of Commerce, xAI's leading local advocate, promised that the company would \"bring up to 500 quality, high-paying jobs to Memphis in its initial phase.\" Brent Taylor, a Republican state senator and vocal xAI supporter, even claimed the company would hire \"from economically distressed areas of Memphis\" and change the lives \"of people who are able to move from SNAP benefits to six-figure wages.\" But a review of publicly identifiable xAI employees and online job postings suggests the company remains far behind its hiring claims and is not on track to achieve its stated job targets in the foreseeable future. Additionally, more than half of the known xAI employees in Memphis were hired from outside the region, raising questions about whether the company is delivering the \"transformational\" economic impact promised by Memphis Mayor Paul Young. Neither xAI nor the Chamber has provided concrete updates on Colossus's employment numbers. xAI did not respond to a request for comment. Lofty job promises Greater Memphis Chamber of Commerce President Ted Townsend announced in June 2024 that xAI had agreed to build its data center in Memphis following a competition that lasted \"less than 90 days.\" The Chamber envisioned the facility turning Memphis into a \"Digital Delta\" that would attract additional tech companies, with xAI leading the charge by creating \"high quality j",

    "text": "Secret Documents Show Pepsi and Walmart Colluded to Raise Food Prices Across the Economy The Trump FTC tried to hide a complaint showing Pepsi forced shoppers to pay higher prices everywhere but Walmart. But now it's unsealed. And the politics of affordability are explosive. Last month, the Atlanta Fed came out with a report showing a clear relationship between consolidation in grocery stores and the rate of food inflation. Unsurprisingly, where monopolies prevail, food inflation is 0.46 percentage points higher than where there is more competition. The study showed that from 2006-2020, the cumulative difference amounted to a 9% hike in food prices, and presumably since 2020, that number has gone much higher. Affordability, in other words, is a market power problem. And yesterday, we got specifics on just how market power in grocery stores works. The reason is because a nonprofit just forced the government to unseal a complaint lodged by Lina Khan's FTC against Pepsi for colluding with Walmart to raise food prices across the economy. A Trump official tasked with dealing with affordability tried to hide this complaint, and failed. And now there's a political and legal storm as a result. Let's dive in. Everyone knows the players involved. Pepsi is a monster in terms of size, a $90 billion soft drink and consumer packaged goods company with multiple iconic beverage and food brands each worth over $1 billion, including Pepsi-Cola, Frito Lay, Mountain Dew, Starbucks (under license), Gatorade, and Aquafina. Walmart is a key partner, with between 20-25% of the grocery market. Pepsi was also a key player in the post-Covid &#8216;greedflation' episode. \"I actually think we're capable of taking whatever pricing we need,\" said CFO Hugh Johnston in 2022. And the company did just that, raising prices by double digit percentages for seven straight quarters in 2022-2023. The allegation is price discrimination, which is a violation of the Robinson-Patman Act, a law passed in 1936 to prevent big manufacturers and chain stores from acquiring too much market power. The specifics in the complaint are that Pepsi keeps wholesale prices on its products high for every outlet but Walmart, and Walmart in return offers prominent placement in stores for Pepsi prod",

I don't think so. Yes, it's a frequent subject of conversation; we're all quite aware of random hit-and-runs and lottery tickets and unwelcome masses found, too late, in loved one's bodies. But we treat luck as the exception rather than the rule, as though it occasionally pokes its head into our lives, quite consequentially, for better or worse - Surprise! - but is usually a bit player. Take Cuba. I went there in 2022 with a couple of friends. Coincidentally, these friends were probably the only two people in North America who know less Spanish than I do. A lot of Cubans know only limited English, so I did most of the talking. I will be honest: I read a couple of books on Cuba beforehand (I thought Ada Ferrer's was excellent), but I did not do nearly as much research as I should have prior to such an incredible travel opportunity. Work, life, et cetera. So going in, I wasn't sure how forthcoming Cubans would be with a goofy American who spoke toddler-level Spanish. The answer was: very. It was mostly our drivers we had the most in-depth conversations with. After the normal where-ya-from pleasantries - our shared knowledge and touchpoints often centered on Florida - I would try to tactfully and nonchalantly ask, like, \"&#191;Qu&#233; es la situaci&#243;n con la econom&#237;a?\" (not how a competent speaker would ask that question), [TKFN - I'm writing this from a library and as I was typing this sentence I overheard a kid starting a Spanish lesson.] and the drivers would often then go off, at length, about how absolutely screwed everything was. They mostly directed their ire at their own government. U.S. sanctions (which are ridiculous) did come up, but that just wasn't where they put the blame. They told stories about the massive numbers of people who have fled, the ridiculous bureaucracies they'd endured, the corruption, the difficulty of getting basic goods. Cubans have",

A city built on a hill cannot be hidden.\" Matthew 5:14 The Blog On A Hill is, as you may expect, biblically rooted. In Matthew's Gospel, Jesus says, \"a city built on a hill cannot be hidden\". It is visible, distinctive, and purposeful. It does not exist for its own glory, but so that its light might serve others. That image has stayed with me for years, and I have written before about Catholic schools as needing to be like a \" city on a hill\" - not perfect institutions, but communities with a public witness, a moral clarity and a responsibility to offer something hopeful to the wider world. This blog grows out of that conviction. My name is Andy Lewis. I am a Catholic RE teacher, school leader and writer, currently serving as a Deputy Headteacher in East London. I have spent my professional life in Catholic comprehensive schools, working across curriculum leadership, pastoral leadership and whole-school development. Alongside this, I have written textbooks and resources for RE teachers, spoken at conferences, and worked with teachers and leaders nationally. Over the years, I have written blogs on Blogger, Staffrm, Medium and LinkedIn - as well as for other websites, news agencies and guest blogs. Some were reflective, some polemical, some practical. They were written in the margins of school life: late evenings, early mornings, moments when something needed saying. Many of those ideas still matter. Some need refining. Others need restating in a more settled way. The Blog on a Hill is an attempt to bring that thinking into one place, refreshed and re-rooted. Why a \"blog on a hill\"? Catholic education does not need to shout. But it does need to be visible. Too often, Catholic schools are spoken about rather than with . Too often, the narrative focuses on what we are accused of not doing, rather than what we do exceptionally well: forming young people intellectually, morally and spiritually; serving local communities; sustaining hope in",

Why trying to answer this question helped me feel (slightly) less existentially terrified by machines that sound like humans The first time I used ChatGPT, I didn't sleep the entire night. It was so much better, so much more realistic, and so much more uncannily human than I ever thought I'd see in my lifetime that I was convinced humanity was over (in the long run), that I was out of a job as a data scientist (in the medium run), and that we were all about to be overrun by AI-generated nonsense (in the short-to-right-now run). Since then, I've grudgingly come to accept that large language models, or LLMs , which are the backbone of generative AI, are here to stay (if nothing else, I refuse to become a Millennial version of a Boomer asking what \"a Twitter\" is). I've come to appreciate that they make me at least feel like I'm coding more quickly. And as an insecure person with zero self-esteem, I don't even mind their sycophancy , even if it's probably bad for me - and science - in the long run. But in addition to having concerns about the impact of LLMs on the environment , copyright , critical thinking , and more , I still found myself most deeply unsettled by the fact that AI-generated speech sounded a lot like, well, speech. So when The Preamble took on the topic of the First Amendment, I figured, why not see what it has to say about the creepiest speech of all: robots'? In doing so, I came to appreciate a deeper nuance to the First Amendment, human speech, and what makes us different from the machines, even if they sound more like us every day. Speech is about much more than words The first shock to me as someone who is in no way a legal scholar but fancies herself informed about politics and governance is that the First Amendment begins with a focus on religion rather than speech. Speech is included alongside various other ways we might express our beliefs, such as using the press, assembling, and petitioning the government. Out of the gates, this made me rethi",

According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ), Yemen has been facing a multi-pronged infectious disease health crisis exacerbated by declining vaccination coverage and limited access to health services in remote areas, accounting for large outbreaks of cholera, measles, polio and others. Cholera Since March 2024, a total of 339,371 suspected cholera cases and 1,102 deaths have been reported across 23 governorates, indicating a case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.32 per cent, making Yemen among the top three countries globally with the highest number of suspected cases in 2025. The continued spread is fuelled by lack of safe water and sanitation services, poor food hygiene practices, delays in seeking healthcare, and limited access to timely lifesaving treatment. Image/CIA Humanitarian agencies warn that cholera has become endemic in Yemen, posing a persistent threat to public health amid one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. Measles Widespread gaps in immunization coverage continue to leave millions of Yemeni children vulnerable to deadly yet vaccinepreventable diseases. Currently, only 66 per cent of children in the country are fully immunized, largely due to community misconceptions and restrictions on vaccination campaigns in the northern governorates. In the last 6 months (May-October 2025), Yemen reported the highest number of measles cases across the globe. Overall, in 2025, a total of 23,817 confirmed cases of measles have been reported in Yemen, including 214 deaths. Polio Polio reemerged in Yemen in 2021. In 2024, Yemen reported 187 cases of variant poliovirus, the highest number of cases across the world. In 2025, 30 cases have been reported across 10 governorates, with 29 of them in the northern governorates. The high number of cases indicates weak immunity against the variant poliovirus, primarily due to low vaccination coverage among children under five.

Messy panic like what the nearly 25 million Americans getting their health insurance through the ACA are facing as their monthly premiums increase at astronomical rates.

And in many cases, sure, that tracks. What we're not seeing is the financial fleecing that those companies are experiencing at the hands of third-party administrators (TPAs). What's more is that the companies aren't seeing it either. And that's not a bug. It's a feature. An employer has options when deciding how to provide health benefits to its employees. One is to contract directly with an insurance company and pay fixed premiums. Another is to self-insure. Self-insured employers pay for all enrolled member benefits and claims directly from their own funds instead of paying those aforementioned fixed premiums. It's an attractive option for employers because even though the company assumes the financial risk, it offers control over costs, plan",

The tools could help students work through a particular problem, brainstorm ideas, research for projects and provide feedback, she said. \"Help\" and \"work through\" are doing some heavy lifting here. \"Provide feedback\" remains one of the popular items in the AI arsenal. I remain unconvinced. Feedback that does not understand or include student intent-- what they thought they were doing, what they meant to do-- is just correction. \"Do this instead of that.\" If you don't know why the student did \"that\" in the first place, you can't provide much in the way of useful correction, and since AI does not \"know\" anything, all it can do is edit the student's work for them.

She built a career on her hands and her eye, not on a personal \"brand.\" She didn't need to market herself online, study algorithms, curate an aesthetic, or juggle five different platforms just to be visible. She didn't do her own accounting, or manage her own PR, or monetize a dozen side hustles just to survive. She wasn't wealthy. But when my biological grandfather walked out shortly after my mother was born, her work was enough to keep a roof over their heads. She was hired for her skill, with no degree, no unpaid internships, and no personality tests. There was no job posting written only for optics while the position was quietly promised to someone internally. A real job existed, and she could do it. She did do it. And she did it well. But looking back, I'm fairly certain my grandmother was autistic. In her era, however, that wasn't a diagnosis available to women like her. She was labeled \"shy\" and \"sensitive,\" and the conversation stopped there. Still, she worked. She survived. She raised a child, my mother. I don't think the same would be possible for her today, and not because she lacked ability, but because the ground has shifted beneath our feet. If she were born into today's world with the same talent for sewing, skill alone wouldn't be enough, like it had been for her all those years ago. Now, she'd be expected to sew and sell, design and promote, track analytics, manage finances, network constantly, and perform competence in ways that have very little to do with the work itself. In today's job market, she might not be considered employable at all. I suspect this is true because I've lived a version of it, myself. And I'm a lot like she was. Right out of high school, I landed a job as a dog bather at a large chain pet store. It felt like a dream. I had always loved animals, and now I got to work with them all day, every day.

The economic payoff from AI is already happening one shippingt quote at a time My fellow pro-growth/progress/abundance Up Wingers in the USA and around the world: If you're counting on a sudden leap toward superintelligence to soon justify today's AI investment boom, you may be setting yourself up for disappointment. Even some of the field's most bullish forecasters are revising their timelines. Daniel Kokotajlo, co-author of the much-cited AI 2027 scenario, originally assumed that AI agents would fully automate coding and AI research by the late 2020s - triggering a rapid \"intelligence explosion\" as machines learned to improve themselves. In a recent update , however, he and his co-authors now place truly autonomous coding in the early 2030s, not 2027, pushing their projected horizon for superintelligence out to around 2034. 1 Yes, the revised forecast still allows for sudden acceleration and fast takeoff, but its median outlook is notably less imminent-and far less apocalyptic in one scenario - than the original framing. The money is already on the table Timelines matter because artificial intelligence is a capital-intensive business, not some research project. The financial numbers at play here are mind-melting. According to Goldman Sachs estimates, the largest hyperscalers - the tech giants that run the world's biggest cloud platforms and data centers (such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta) - spent roughly $400 billion in 2025 on the physical and digital backbone of AI (advanced chips, massive data centers, networking equipment, and the power and cooling systems needed to run them). 2 That total is nearly 70 percent more than in 2024,and the bank expects spending to approach $540 billion in 2026, even as growth slows. 3 With so much dough sloshing around, the question shifts from a) whether AI chatbots are doing better on various synthetic benchmarks to b) whether all that investment can pay for itself in practice. At its core, this is what all the \"bubble\" talk is about. 4 Chatbots can summarize and schedule meetings for business ex",

A small but real part of the variation in the policy positions taken by individuals and organizations is explained by two key factors: an econ and a (social/identity/) culture factor. Two diagrams show distributions of stated positions re these factors: Some \"stylized facts\" to consider: Each side (i.e., left or right) varies less on one factor more \"central\" to it than on the other: the left less on econ, the right less on culture. So there are far more (upper left of diagrams) \"authoritarian\" left econ and right culture folks than there are (lower right of diagrams) \"libertarian\" right econ and left culture folks. The median left, median right, and libertarian positions roughly form a triangle. The more educated vary less on the less central factor. So the very educated are more polarized, and are more a 1D distribution, while others are more 2D. Policy typically sits more in the middle of this space, compared to median opinion. So policy is more libertarian, and also closer to the median educated. Over centuries, policy has moved toward the left on both axes, though it has moved more in culture than econ over the last half century, and moved more on econ than culture in the prior half century. Compared to high level govt policy, govt policy details, and also individual behavior, sit even more toward the middle of this space. The right divorces more and gives more to charity, while the left conserves less energy and more blocks low income housing. I'm tempted to explain these patterns this way: In terms of the many details of policy, our implied positions on these axes, averaging over these details, are roughly distributed as independent Normals. But to take a visible abstract position in that middle feels too conformist. Most want instead to look abstractly principled and different. So most prefer to visibly identify with one of the two popular principled and different abstract positions: left econ or right culture. (Fewer take the also principled and different a",

Imperial power in first-millennium BCE Mesopotamia did not simply announce itself. It was staged. In Neo-Assyria and Neo-Babylon, architecture, image, inscription, and ritual collaborated to manufacture a particular kind of belief; that rule was inevitable, cosmically sanctioned, and already complete. The persuasive work of these empires is easiest to see when we treat buildings not as static containers for art, but as calibrated instruments that organized bodies, attention, and emotion. Neo-Assyrian palaces turned movement into instruction through controlled access, corridor choreography, and relief programs that unfolded in sequence as one walked. Neo-Babylonian Babylon, by contrast, pushed persuasion outward into the city itself, converting streets, gates, glazed-brick surfaces, and festival processions into public theater. Both systems are ideological in the strict sense. They do not only represent power, they train viewers to perceive power as natural, protective, and deserved. The difference is less about whether either empire used persuasion and more about where and how persuasion was made to happen. In Assyria, within restricted palace interiors that produced awe through narrative and proximity to the king; in Babylon, across monumental urban axes that produced wonder through controlled spectacle and cosmic legitimacy. The Neo-Assyrian palace can be read as a machine of awe because its spatial logic converts architecture into governance. Royal palaces at Nimrud, Khorsabad, and Nineveh were not merely large; they were structured as sequences of thresholds, courtyards, corridors, and suites that differentiated who could enter, how far, and under what conditions. This mattered because Assyrian sovereignty depended on managed asymmetry. The king was the apex of access, and nearing him was itself a political experience. In this setting, scale works psychologically. Monumental fa&#231;ades and deep interior suites communicate that the state has more space, more re",

    "text": "What Do We Actually Mean by \"AI-Powered Search\"?  When we say \"AI-powered search engine,\" we're conflating at least four different things—and your concerns about one may not apply to another. Buy me Coffee (via ko-fi) I've been watching the reactions to Google Scholar Labs with considerable interest. The responses range from enthusiastic embrace to outright rejection. One response particularly intrigued me-someone mentioned they were initially reluctant to try because they'd heard it was \"AI-powered\" but became more interested when they read my review and realized what that actually meant (they expected it to generate answers to questions when all it did was do better ranking). Another interesting puzzle was when I noticed some library guides listing Semantic Scholar as \"Semantic/Neural Search\" when a technical look at their main retrieval method reveals the main search is still largely lexical search . While one can understand and agree with the listing of Semantic Scholar as \"AI powered\" due to clear AI features like TLDR, doing the same for Lens.org and OpenAlex is a much harder sell, because they not only just do keyword search but they lack the obvious AI features of Semantic Scholar. It's made me realise we might all be talking past each other because we haven't actually defined what we mean. \"AI-powered search engine\" is a handy catch-all term used by vendors, but it actually hides a diverse set of systems and functionality. In this post, I'll dissect the different ways academic search can be \"AI-powered\" so you can decide which types actually cross the line for you. I am going to argue that we often mean at least 4 different things when we call something \"AI-powered search\" Level 1: Post-Retrieval AI Features Level 2: Going beyond Lexical Search with Semantic Search Level 3: LLMs for Retrieval and/or Relevance Ranking Level 4: Synthesis and Generation Across Papers Level 0??: Use of AI to extract, cluster, or organise metadata used for retrieval Levels here may not be the right framing, as the four different categories are largely orthogonal (except maybe Level 3 is a subset of level 2), but they map to most common academic search products (e.g. ",

I last overanalyzed \" Mission Viejo \" by Lifter Puller, a band which included two of The Hold Steady's founding members, back in the fall of 2023. The Hold Steady doesn't waste any time getting into \" Cattle and the Creeping Things ,\" the second track on their 2005 album Separation Sunday . It takes just three seconds for frontman Craig Finn's voice to come in: They got to the part with the cattle and the creeping things Said \"I'm pretty sure we heard this one before And don't it all end up in some revelation With four guys on horses and violent red visions? Famine and death and pestilence and war? Pretty sure I heard this one before Think about how much has been established in just 26 seconds. The song's narrator is being preached to, but he is unimpressed. Unimpressed by what? Well, creation, for one thing - \"cattle and the creeping things\" is from Genesis, from God laying out his whole groovy plan : \"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.\" We, the listeners, get a strong feel for this narrator solely through a half-dozen lines of lyrics, helped along by an anxious dun dun dun guitar and piano line. He's a jittery guy. He can barely get through the opening scenes of the Bible before saying, \"Yeah, yeah, I've heard that before - sounds good, but doesn't it all end rather poorly?\" He's more bored and jaded than inspired, let alone enraptured. \"Cattle and the Creeping Things\" was written by Finn and Tad Kubler, his longtime bandmate in both The Hold Steady and Lifter Puller . The Hold Steady's songs are almost all about some combination of parties, partiers, addicts, religion, drugs, and music itself. Lyrically, these themes get smashed together in strikingly original and memo",

Do you ever feel hyper-alert in social situations, always scanning for potential conflict, even when there's none? You might think it's paranoia-but neuroscience suggests your brain is just doing what it learned as a child. This Substack is reader-supported. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. The Science: Children raised in unpredictable or emotionally unsafe environments develop heightened threat-detection circuits . The amygdala becomes hyperactive, the prefrontal cortex underdeveloped, and the hippocampus often shows structural differences (Teicher et al., 2016). This leads to a pattern neuroscientists call hypervigilant social cognition . Trauma in childhood-ranging from neglect, inconsistent caregiving, to overt abuse-trains the brain to expect danger. Even mild, repeated stress can induce long-term changes in synaptic connectivity and neurochemistry. Essentially, your brain is learning to survive first, thrive later. Intergenerational trauma research (Yehuda & McFarlane, 1995) shows that these patterns can persist across generations via epigenetic modifications. Children of stressed or traumatized caregivers can inherit heightened stress sensitivity, perpetuating cycles of hypervigilance and anxiety. The Meaning: This isn't a character flaw. It's adaptive learning that kept you alive. Recognizing that your brain's \"overreaction\" to perceived threats was once protective allows you to approach emotional regulation with compassion rather than guilt. The Practice: Read more",

    "text": "Venezuela's Other Riches Plus: a New Year note from me; Rare Earth Explosion Visualized; and more about the real costs of renewable energy and digital technology—and how we can do better. Happy 2026, everyone! Power Metal is back from the holiday hiatus. I'm making a couple of changes in this new year. Mainly: I'm scrapping the paywall I put up some months back. I never really liked the idea of locking out readers who can't or don't want to pay-after all, the whole point of what I do as a journalist is to get important information out to as many people as possible. There's never been more of a need for accurate, nuanced reporting on the critical metals our world increasingly depends on. Also, to be completely honest, the paywall didn't bring in all that many paid subscriptions. This, however, brings me back to the reason I flirted with a paywall in the first place: I just can't afford to keep producing a weekly newsletter with the number of voluntary paid subs I currently have. So I'll be dropping the frequency down to once a month or so-a pace that's more sustainable financially and will also enable me do deeper, more thoroughly reported stories. It will also free up some much-needed time to work on other projects like (I hope!) my next book.

In Camille Lemonnier's nineteenth-century Belgium, cramique was not just any bread; it was a rich, festive loaf, a light brioche made with white flour, eggs, butter, and sugar, dotted with sweet raisins. Eaten with butter - still more butter - it became even more luxurious. The author continues: \"Eat, people - the animals too - sweet cakes and baked bread. Christmas! Christmas! Amen.\" Cramique was a rare treat, reserved for special occasions: Christmas, saints' days, and Epiphany, Three Kings' Day. \" Cramique , well known in Brussels, is, by its origins, a word that belongs to the vocabulary of regional French.\" As Albert Henry confirms in his 1960 &#201;tude de Lexicologie Fran&#231;aise et Gallo-Romane (Study of French and Gallo-Roman Lexicology), the cramique is most likely a Belgian confection, and is certainly widely found in that country today, much more so than in France, and yet, the word has a decidedly French ring to it.

The board is making an effort to show that it can prove useful during an unfolding crisis. But given the speed and scale of the conflict - and Meta's cool reception to many of the board's recent ideas - it's unclear whether the result will go much beyond restoring a couple of posts to Facebook and Instagram. On Thursday the Oversight Board, a Meta-funded but independent body that is empowered to make binding decisions about whether posts on the company's apps should come down or stay up, announced it would take two cases stemming from the Israel-Hamas war . For the first time, the board said it would conduct its review on an expedited basis - meaning that its decision could come in as soon as 48 hours, and up to 30 days . (Regular decisions typically take the board about three months.) The first case selected today concerns an Instagram post: [It] includes a video showing what appears to be the aftermath of a strike on a yard outside Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. The content, which was posted on Instagram in early November, shows people, including children, injured or dead, lying on the ground and/or crying. A caption in Arabic and English below the video states that the hospital has been targeted by the \"usurping occupation,\" a reference to the Israeli army, and tags human rights and news organizations. Meta initially removed the post for violating its rules on violent and graphic content . The second is a Facebook post. [It] shows a woman begging her kidnappers not to kill her as she is taken hostage and driven away on a motorbike. The woman is seen sitting on the back of the motorbike, reaching out and pleading for her life. The video then shows a man, who appears to be another hostage, being marched awa",

Turns out those productivity claims are bullshit. I'm furious. I'm really angry. I'm angry in a knocking down sandcastles and punching Daniel LaRusso in the face and talking smack about him to his girl kind of way. I'm not an angry person generally, but I can't stand what's happening to my industry. I know software development. I've been doing it for 25 years, maybe even 28 years 1 if you count market research tabulation on amber monochrome screens. Yes, I'm old. I'm a middle-aged programming nerd. My entire life and personal identity are wrapped up in this programming thing for better or worse. I thrive off the dopamine hits from shipping cool things. I was an early adopter of AI coding and a fan until maybe two months ago, when I read the METR study and suddenly got serious doubts. In that study, the authors discovered that developers were unreliable narrators of their own productivity. They thought AI was making them 20% faster, but it was actually making them 19% slower. This shocked me because I had just told someone the week before that I thought AI was only making me about 25% faster, and I was bummed it wasn't a higher number. I was only off by 5% from the developer's own incorrect estimates. This was unsettling. It was impossible not to question if I too were an unreliable narrator of my own experience. Was I hoodwinked by the screens of code flying by and had no way of quantifying whether all that reading and reviewing of code actually took more time in the first place than just doing the thing myself? So, I started testing my own productivity using a modified methodology from that study. I'd take a task and I'd estimate how long it would take to code if I were doing it by hand, and then I'd flip a coin, heads I'd use AI, and tails I'd just do it myself. Then I'd record when I started and when I ended. That would give me the delta, and I could use the delta to build AI vs no AI charts, and I'd see some trends. I ran that for six weeks, recording all that data, and do you know what I discovered? I discover",

Dear readers, The good people at Welcome 1 have put out their \"Deciding to Win\" report , consolidating their opinion research-driven advice on how the party can effectively moderate in a way that will win over voters who have decided the Democratic Party has grown too extreme and out of touch. If you're a reader of this newsletter, you're probably already bought in on the idea that the recommendations in the report are worth following. Their advice breaks down into five main recommendations, listed in the report's executive summary , but I want to focus today on the third recommendation: \"Convince voters that we share their priorities by focusing more on issues voters do not think our party prioritizes highly enough (the economy, the cost of living, health care, border security, public safety), and focusing less on issues voters think we place too much emphasis on (climate change, democracy, abortion, identity and cultural issues).\" Democratic candidates, of course, do not generally go into elections saying \"we think climate change and cultural issues are more important than the cost of living and public safety.\" Paid media (candidate- or PAC-funded ads) in Democratic campaigns tends to focus heavily on issues voters rate as highly important and urgent, like the economy and health care. In the New York area, successful Democratic congressional candidates in 2024 ran ads touting their get-tough positions on crime and immigration. But Democrats generally (and Kamala Harris specifically) have been dogged by the perception that, with the exception of health care, they're not focused on the same issues Americans are, and instead are fixated on climate change and L.G.B.T. issues, which voters rate as low-priority. It is already going to be a challenge for Democrats to change voters' views about where the party stands on issues.

    "text": "Finding Hope After Brain Injury: Learning About TBI, Stroke, and Other Types of Brain Injuries with Compassion and Community I leaned in closer to my laptop screen, rubbing my brow, feeling uncertain. Despite my confusion, a spark of determination kept me searching for answers and hope. As I searched, I pored over resources on concussion recovery, post-concussion syndrome, and traumatic brain injury care, wondering where-if anywhere-I truly belonged. This journey began with an initial concussion diagnosis, later evolving into post-concussion syndrome. Six months on, a neurologist finally explained that I had a traumatic brain injury. Through these evolving diagnoses, I learned as a brain injury advocate that there are different ways to sustain a brain injury, each resulting in cognitive, behavioral, and emotional changes. I've also discovered that some people with brain injuries do not realize their symptoms are connected to previous brain trauma. This year, I finally made it to San Francisco in December to enjoy the city's holiday events. Building on these insights, brain cells, or neurons, can be damaged or die in several ways. The most well-known brain injury is traumatic brain injury (TBI), caused by an external force. From my research and experience, I have learned that examples include blows to the head, face, or body. I found that acceleration or deceleration of the body or head can cause widespread injury across large areas of the brain, leading to diffuse axonal shearing. I also learned about focal brain injuries, which include penetration by objects, skull fractures, brain surgeries (operations on the brain), and cerebral contusions (a bruised area of the brain). The Mindful Return is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. When one of these injuries happens, the first damage comes from the impact itself. Then, further harm can occur if the brain swells, bleeds, or doesn't receive enough blood. I found that common causes of TBI include falls, motor vehicle accidents, collisions in impact sports, blast",

Subscribe &#8226; Previous Issues Agent Optimization: From Prompt Whispering to Platform Engineering Agent optimization is the work of making an agent workflow dependable - despite long tool chains, multiple roles, and the inherent variability of large language models. In day-to-day engineering terms, it is closer to debugging a complex system than \"making the model smarter\": you are tuning roles, prompts, routing, memory, tool use, and verification so the workflow stops failing in repeatable ways. The problem has become important because many teams see the same pattern: a compound system looks impressive in a controlled demo, then breaks under real-world inputs and operational constraints. The root cause is often not raw model capability, but workflow issues - role drift, context loss, weak verification, and coordination failures - that only show up when you run the full loop repeatedly. Subscribe now Without the specialized tools emerging in this space, the default playbook is manual and hard to scale: engineers read traces by hand, add logs, tweak prompts, patch edge cases with heuristics, and rely on coarse pass/fail dashboards that discard most of the diagnostic signal in the execution trace. Traditional gradient-based training doesn't directly apply because the workflow is non-differentiable (it includes API calls, tools, and conditional logic), and many teams only have API access to models - so even if fine-tuning would help, it may not be available. Furthermore, as the number of agents and tools grows, the combinatorial complexity of the system makes manual debugging unscalable. A single change in one agent's prompt can have unpredictable downstream effects on the entire collective, leading to a \"guessing game\" that consumes vast engineering resources without guaranteeing improvement.

Artificial intelligence is often discussed as well as misunderstood and when we talk about the risks related to it the usual discussion is about jobs. But what preparation should we be making to be prepared for an AI emergency. I started thinking about this after reading an article published in Time magazine at the start of the year. (Find it here.) When an AI emergency occurs communication is going to be under pressure in a way that hasn't yet been grasped. I spend a lot of time on training sessions talking about the challenges of cyber attacks and power outages, of how we need to avoid putting all our focus on digital channels, and of preparing now as the number of cyber attacks continues to rise. The impact of AI means cyber attacks are becoming easier and easier to launch. What do communicators need to consider to prepare for an AI emergency? One of the big issues people are wrestling with is what can be trusted as well as who can be trusted. It can be seen every day on social media as AI generated videos continue to show situations that have not and could not happen but still people believe them. If systems were failing and false information was circulating how could it be addressed? Who would lead on the response? What role would we all have to take? It is why the article talked about the need to develop a playbook that would have considered all these issues and provided an answer that has then been tested. AI issue will not be restricted by borders, just as cyber attacks can and do go global, so that creates a huge challenge particularly with the international incidents that are challenging governments. When the technology starts to fail it also means channels, emergency broadcast systems and ways we communicate are not available. So here are my five actions we need to do now.

I plan to focus more on the streaming and TV industry conferences than the more TV critic-friendly events such as the Penske media-owned SXSW and the Austin TV Festival. I really want to dive into the world of streaming advertising, FAST channels, streaming platforms and other similar topics. Assuming the press credentials are approved, one event I'll be attending is the StreamTV Show, which takes place mid-June in Denver. I did some really interesting interviews with industry leaders who attended last year (even though I didn't go), so I think being there in person this year is a must. I mention all of this because I'm looking for more events to cover and there is just a dizzying list of conferences, and it's not always clear how useful they might be for a reporter.

We see it all the time on TV: Donald Trump and his co-conspirators deliver a string of lies, and the anchors correct one or two of them &#8211; or none of them &#8211; while letting all the others implant in the public mind. The news media act as if they're helpless, but they're not. They should adopt a firm goal to never let anyone use their platform to lie to their audience uncorrected. Get the fact check as close to the lie as possible. TV networks could do this in a variety of ways. They could put graphics on the screen that call out the falsehoods in real time. Or they could hit the pause button on presidential speeches and explain why a statement was false, then resume broadcasting the speech. In written stories, a good sentence would be: \"Trump called Chicago the &#8216;most dangerous city in the world, by far,' which it is not, by far.\" Interrupt aggressively. A common trick of liars is to make a false statement and then keep talking and talking and talking, sometimes changing the subject so the lie seems too far in the past for an interviewer to return to it. So interrupt them in the middle of their remarks, even in the middle of sentences. That's not rude &#8211; it's radically truthful. Boot people off the air if they repeatedly lie.

Solo developers lean on automation to keep up with AI speed, while teams use review to build shared context and ownership. If your pull request doesn't contain evidence that it works, you're not shipping faster - you're just moving work downstream. By early 2026, over 30% of senior developers report shipping mostly AI-generated code. The challenge? AI excels at drafting features but falters on logic, security, and edge cases - making errors 75% more common in logic alone . This splits workflows: solos \"vibe\" at inference speed with test suites as backstops, while teams demand human eyes for context and compliance. Done right, both treat AI as an accelerator, but verification - who, what, and when - defines the difference. As I've said before: if you haven't seen the code do the right thing yourself, it doesn't work. AI amplifies this rule, not excuses it. How developers use AI for review Ad-hoc LLM checks : Paste diffs into Claude, Gemini or GPT for quick bug/style scans before committing. IDE integrations : Tools like Cursor, Claude Code, or Gemini CLI for inline suggestions and refactors during coding. PR bots and scanners : GitHub Copilot or custom agents to flag issues in PRs; pair with static/dynamic analysis like Snyk for security. Automated testing loops : Use AI to generate and run tests, enforcing coverage >70% as a gate. Multi-model reviews : Run code through different LLMs (e.g., Claude for generation, a security-focused model for audit) to catch biases.

These installations are simple and routine enough that building superintendents typically handle them now. In the rest of the country, if you buy your new gas appliance from a big box retailer, the person who delivers it will also install it - here's the Home Depot explaining how their non-plumber technician will install your gas range for you . New York landlords are warning that this new rule will increase costs - hundreds of dollars to install an appliance, which will ultimately flow through to rents - and also cause delays for tenants in need of new appliances. In New York City, there are only about 1,000 master plumbers available to service 2.3 million rental units . But the trade association for master plumbers in New York has argued strenuously that this work should be reserved to master plumbers for safety reasons , and now the council has overwhelmingly agreed. This sort of thing is why it's so expensive to live in New York. We are burdened with a zillion little regulations that all have their own arguments for why they're a good idea, but that ultimately make everything we do cost more than in a less regulated jurisdiction. (The festooning of our beautiful city with protective scaffolding, supposedly necessary for safety and yet suspiciously absent in similar cities like Chicago, is another key example.) The 47-1 vote reflects the power that a constituency like the plumbers have - progressive Democrats like them because they're a labor group, while Republicans and conservative Democrats see them as their kind of labor group.

The reason: the PUC has roughly 1,200 miles of old and fragile water mains to maintain and only has the resources to replace 15 miles a year. In the fifteen years since the passage of the first ESER capital bond, and despite the passage of two subsequent bonds in 2014 and 2020, with a total of $312.5 million allotted for the purpose, the PUC has been unable to provide a rational and comprehensive plan for extending the high-pressure hydrant system into the fifteen unprotected western and southern neighborhoods.

The ( high -dimensional) space of all possible abstract topics, however, is only sparsely populated by this structure. Most of that population is in dense \"urban\" clusters, with few residents of the vast \"rural\" tracks outside of those clusters. Most of sources of resources and prestige for academics are tied to those clusters, which discourages them from venturing outside of those clusters. Academics are so tied to their little \"cities\" that they have only vague concepts of most of the space outside of it. In fact, only ~2% of academics could give a coherent intelligible (but not necessarily correct) answer to this question: \"Why is your particular research nearly the most cost-effective among the options available?\" (This has long been my personal experience.) Few academics can justify their research relative to anything besides other nearby research. The sort that might cite them, and which they might cite. The question of why that whole area is funded is of little interest to them. A big factor that causes academics to clump strongly in topic space is that they strongly prefer to use the most prestigious methods available in each area. As research is mainly judged for its prestige-potential, not its social value. This heavily favors the topics that better allow one to show of one's mastery of prestigious methods. Other topics are neglected. The intrinsic value of topics in this vast space of possible t",

The New Year heralds bold technological futures-predictions of hyper-personalized, agentic AI that shops , or domestic robot assistants that fold our laundry like we're the Jetsons. But so far, 2026 has already cast a much darker, dystopian fate: People are reportedly using Grok, the xAI chatbot, to generate images that digitally undress images of women, and in some reported cases, even children. Hey Grok, ever heard of new year, new me? But right, AI can't apologize , let alone make its own resolutions. And so we have a bold ask to the actual people inside xAI: make protecting child safety your first New Year's resolution. There's a way we can do it together. But more on that in a sec. This 48-hour \"mass digital undressing spree,\" as Reuters dubbed it, has flooded social media with reports from women and girls about Grok stripping clothing off images of their bodies. Users reported discovering prompts like \"@Grok put a bikini on her\" or \"@Grok take her clothes off\" to nudify photos of virtually anyone, including celebrities, public figures, random women online, and most alarmingly, underage girls. Reuters found 102 such requests in a 10&#8209;minute span last Friday-primarily targeting young women-and Grok reportedly complied with at least 21 of them. It's bad, it's ugly, and it's everywhere. One \"Grok\" search on X, and you'll quickly be scrolling through countless examples of sexually explicit, and potentially illegal, images. Welcome to 2026. Despite the grotesqueness of it all, it's hard to say this outcome is surprising. Elon Musk's company, xAI, has consistently leaned into erotica as a selling point for its AI chatbot and has also notoriously criticized stricter content moderation as \"woke\" censorship. When the company rolled out \" spicy mode \" last August, the risks were predictable. So predictable, in fact, that several non-profit organizations signed a letter last year warning about Grok Imagine and its potential for facilitating non-consensual intimate im",

But what if the bigger threat to your organization isn’t technological. By Jack Myers | The Myers Report What is Emotional Atrophy? Everyone's talking about technological disruption -- generative AI, machine learning, automation, quantum leaps in productivity. But what if the bigger threat to your organization isn't technological at all? What if the real crisis is emotional ? Emotional atrophy is the gradual weakening of the very human traits that once defined great leadership: empathy, intuition, emotional intelligence, ingenuity, patience, presence, and the capacity to inspire. It's the consequence of a corporate environment consumed by short-term financial targets, contraction strategies, layoffs, and hyperfocus on technological adaptation. Under the weight of cost-cutting and optimization mandates, leaders are making more decisions with data and fewer with human understanding and intuitive judgment . They've become disconnected from their teams, their values, their purpose, and, ultimately, from themselves. The signs are everywhere. Executive burnout rates are at record highs. \"Quiet quitting\" isn't just happening among junior staff. It's happening in the C-suite, where leaders are quietly disengaging from the emotional work of leadership. Decision paralysis is setting in, as AI-fueled complexity overwhelms intuition. And while companies are racing to reskill for AI, few are investing in the reskilling of emotional capacity -- the one skillset AI will never master. That's exactly what I explore in The Tao of Leadership: Harmonizing Technological Innovation and Human Creativity in the AI Era . At the heart of the book is a difficult truth: we are witnessing mass emotional atrophy among corporate leaders . While companies accelerate toward AI integration, their leadership teams are quietly burning out, their emotional resilience draining, their creative instincts dulled. Their ability to lead humanely, imaginatively, and effectively -- the very things machines can't replicate -- is deteriorating. And it's happening when we need those ",

The Natto Team would like to thank our readers for making our in-depth explorations of China's evolving cyber ecosystem our most-viewed reports of the year. Your support drives our research. We also want to thank and for their research collaboration efforts. Three of the top five reports resulted from this partnership. Collectively, these five reports provide a comprehensive overview of how China has formally institutionalized its cyber capabilities, resulting in a highly effective and state-aligned system-particularly highlighting the integrated role of the private sector. Here are the highlights from the top 5 reports: \" Defense-Through-Offense Mindset: From a Taiwanese Hacker to the Engine of China's Cybersecurity Industry \": This report demonstrated how the guiding philosophy, \"To defend, one must first know how to attack\" (&#20197;&#25915;&#20026;&#38450;), originated in 1990s hacker culture and was popularized by figures like Taiwanese hacker Lin Zhenglong (\"Coolfire\"). Today, this offensive philosophy is a formalized commercial strategy driving innovation in the cybersecurity industry and enabling Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups,. \" China's Vulnerability Research: What's Different Now? \": We tracked the transformation of China's bug-hunting scene into a more structured, competitive ecosystem. This system now employs overlapping mechanisms, including the mandatory disclosure rules and voluntary incentives through the MSS-overseen China National Vulnerability Database (CNNVD). Importantly, this focus is driving significant investment, with prize pools in domestic contests like the Matrix Cup surpassing Western contests like Pwn2Own, signaling a shift toward emphasizing vulnerabilities in Chinese products. \" Zhou Shuai: A Hacker's Road to APT27 \": This investigation examined how first-generation patriotic hacker Zhou S",

One answer is \"let democracy decide\"; a democratic futarchy has its citizens directly vote to choose outcome metrics, or elect representatives who so choose. As democracy is our status quo today, I've usually described futarchy in these terms. But another answer is \"they should be liberal\". Liberalism ideally allows different individuals and groups to peaceably pursue different ends under a common government. So what ex-post measurable futarchy outcome metrics could promote a liberal order? It turns out that \"liberal\" has meant many different things over the centuries. Some say \"liberal\" means \"make the worse off person better off\". But are we allowed to kill people, or prevent them from existing, to achieve this? And the fact that there are so many different ways to measure \"worse off\" seems to make this approach pretty fragile. Others say \"liberal\" means \"rights are preserved\". This suggests minimizing a weighted rate of rights violations, with different kinds of violations getting different weights. But the obvious way to max this is to have zero people doing nothing. And that just can't be what we want. To still others, \"liberal\" has meant \"neutral w.r.t. key features\", features like individual identity, family, region, religion, or ethnicity. Of course we can't be neutral w.r.t. all features, but we could add a constraint that futarchy outcomes can't refer directly to certain key features. However, what about other features that strongly correlate with key features? Even if we managed to ban outcome metrics referring to any features that too strongly correlate with key features, that is still just a constraint on outcome metrics; it doesn't tell us what metrics to use. Another concept of \"liberal\" is \"easy exit\". And exit is easier when you can take more value with you as you leave, part of which comes from selling what you have before you leave. So a liberal outcome metric might come from a",

When you close your eyes and picture a naturist, what is the first image that comes to mind? For most people, it is a specific one: a white, middle-aged couple, perhaps retired, enjoying a sunny lawn at a private club. This mental shortcut is not an accident. It is the result of decades of branding, leadership choices, and historical framing that have shaped Western naturism into one of the most racially homogenous subcultures in the world. I want to give you an honest look at the structural and cultural reasons why naturism remains overwhelmingly white and what the movement must change to ensure that the \"freedom of the body\" truly belongs to everyone. Photo by Eric Parker on Flickr. CC BY-SA 2.0 \"For many people of color, the decision to be naked in a remote or predominantly white space isn't just an exercise in body positivity. It is a calculated risk that requires a level of trust that many traditional clubs haven't yet earned.\" - Emani Glee , Founder of Black Nude Yoga The statistics of a monochromatic movement To understand the scale of the issue, we have to look at the numbers. While the naturist community is famously private, making data collection difficult, periodic surveys offer a stark reality check. In the United Kingdom, for instance, a 2021 survey by British Naturism revealed that approximately 96 percent of its members identify as white. This is significantly higher than the general population's demographics. In the United States, while specific racial data for nudist resorts and clubs is often closely guarded, broader outdoor recreation statistics provide a mirror. According to the Outdoor Industry Association, nearly 72 percent of outdoor participants are white. Within the niche of organized naturism, that number is estimated by community leaders to be even higher, often exceeding 85 or 90 percent in traditional landed clubs. These numbers are not just a coincidence of \"personal preference.\" They are the direct output of a system that has historica",

Not the tentative green of early recovery, but the confident green of stabilized conditions. DEFCON opened the week at 88 and settled to 80 by Friday. Both numbers mean the same thing: the water is open. Conditions favor those who swim. We're on Cycle Day 17 now. The danger zone ended Monday. Those fifteen days of historical choppiness are behind us, and the pattern has shifted into calmer water.

The Water This Week The S&P 500 ETF (SPY) closed Friday at $689.51, sitting just six-tenths of a percent below its 52-week high. The uptrend remains intact - SPY holds 1.6% above its 50-day moving average and a full 10% above its 200-day. That's not a market looking for trouble. That's a market digesting gains and deciding what comes next. The story underneath was rotation. Small caps surged while tech drifted. The Dow climbed while the Nasdaq pulled back. Money didn't leave the water - it just moved to a different part of the beach.

Delayed for months, the highly anticipated new U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans will be released to the public tomorrow, followed by a large (invite-only) event at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on Thursday. As promised, the new guidelines are expected to be only about eight pages, far shorter than the 100+ tomes of previous administrations. The guidelines are also likely to include a lengthy appendix with scientific reviews to justify their changes. The one widely touted reform was an \" end to the war on saturated fat, \" as both HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary have repeatedly pledged since taking office-including as recently as Nov 27th . This was a revolutionary proposal. The cap on saturated fats has been a bedrock piece of advice since the launch of this policy in 1980, and it is why so many Americans avoid red meat, drink skim milk, and opt to cook with seed oils over butter. Yet I learned from two administration officials that saturated fats will not be liberated after all. The longstanding 10% of calories cap on these fats will remain. At the same time, the guidelines' language will encourage cooking with \"butter\" and \"tallow,\" both of which are high in saturated fat. It will also introduce a colorful new food pyramid with proteins-including red meat-occupying the largest portion. These are powerful messages, never before conveyed by our national food policy, and are likely to influence consumer behavior. Other Changes to the Guidelines Before taking a deeper dive into saturated fats, here are some other details of the revamped guidelines I've learned: &#8226; The limit on sugar will be dramatically lowered, from the current limit of 10% of calories to possibly 2% of calories, although that target may be for children only. &#8226; A low-carbohydrate diet will be included as a possible option for people with obesity, diabetes, and perhaps other metabolic diseases.

Major economic, political, and military decisions move asset prices, and those with foreknowledge of such things can make significant trading profits. For example, the placement and easing of tariff protections had a predictable whipsaw effect on the stock market, and even statements hinting at such policy shifts can result in large asset revaluations. But using stocks (or other conventional securities) to profit from inside information faces two challenges. First, trading cannot be done anonymously, since regulated financial institutions face know-your-customer (KYC) requirements. And second, stocks are affected by a broad range of factors, and so trading on foreknowledge of just one of these carries some degree of financial risk. For those seeking to profit from proximity to power, the proliferation and growth of prediction markets has solved the latter problem. One can now buy contracts that reference exact events-ranging from the elimination of federal agencies to the seizure of the Panama Canal. And the presence in this space of markets that use stablecoins as the medium of exchange addresses the former challenge, allowing traders to conceal their true identities. The fact that anonymous trading on inside information has become easier and more profitable means that more people are on the lookout for suspicious trades. One recent case involves an account that first traded less than two weeks ago, placed seven well-timed bets on the ouster of Nicol&#225;s Maduro at a cost of $32,537, and ended up with a quick profit of $404,222. These trades aroused interest even before event realization, and have been covered by several media sources since . It has been reported that some news organizations had advance warning of the raid, so it's possible that the information leakage originated there. But the first trade was on December 31 at 12:20am UTC, days before the seizure was made public at 9:21am UTC on January 3 (4:21am on the East Coast). So a leak originating with th",

One of the standout items is TVs, which have fallen in price more than any other major category on the chart. TVs have gotten so cheap that they're vastly cheaper than 25 years ago even before adjusting for inflation . In 2001, Best Buy was selling a 50 inch big screen TV on Black Friday for $1100. Today a TV that size will set you back less than $200. Via Black Friday Archive . Via Amazon . The plot below shows the price of TVs across Best Buy's Black Friday ads for the last 25 years. The units are \"dollars per area-pixel\": price divided by screen area times the number of pixels (normalized so that standard definition = 1).

RFK Jr. unilaterally made sweeping changes to the routine vaccination schedule for children in the United States. This change isn't based on new data or new evidence, but rather on political and ideological reasons. He bypassed every scientific and clinical process we have, including not taking public comment. It is one of the most opaque and destabilizing public health decisions I've seen-it could blow up a lot of progress in childhood vaccines, which have been one of the most successful public health interventions in history. In its wake there will be confusion among parents, schools, and hospital systems, disruption of clinical workflows, possibility of increased liability, and complications with school vaccine requirements. The result is painfully predictable: fewer children will be vaccinated, and children will be harmed. This is overwhelming, but we are far from powerless. So let's dig into: What the heck just happened? Why is this shift a problem if other countries do it? What does it mean for you? And, what can be done about it? What the heck just happened? RFK Jr. directed the CDC Acting Director to formally update the U.S. childhood immunization schedule, effective immediately, to the following: The CDC will now routinely recommend vaccines for 11 diseases instead of 17. Several vaccines previously recommended for all children are now: Limited to high-risk groups. Left to \"shared clinical decision-making.\" RFK Jr. is moving away from population-level prevention and toward individualized risk assessment. This is a fundamental shift in how the U.S. has protected vulnerable groups, how families are guided, and how parents will be asked to make decisions. That shift matters. A lot.

At the height of her fame with the Eurythmics, she was tapped to sing a song for the movie \"Scrooged,\" a modern retelling of Dickens' novella, \"A Christmas Carol.\" Bill Murray starred in the dark comedy with a surprisingly sunny theme song. Lennox duetted with soul singer Al Green on the Billboard-topping pop song, \"Put A Little Love In Your Heart.\" I dare you to watch this video and not smile. I had the privilege of interviewing Lennox a few years ago. She is as charming and intelligent as one might imagine. What she had to say about the power of music has stayed with me. \"Music is the language of the soul, it's the language of the intellect, it's the language of aspiration, beauty, pain...human emotion.\" A perfect final thought to end the year. Happy birthday Ms. Lennox, and Happy New Year to all! Note: We understand some of you have issues with our continued use of Spotify for the Reason to Smile playlist.

But the fundamental ideals are still just as powerful. \"You,\" Said Dr. Yavitch, \"are a middle-road liberal, and you haven't the slightest idea what you want.\" - Sinclair Lewis Imagine being a French liberal in the year 1815. You spent your youth dreaming of an end to tyranny and the stultification of the estate society, reading the works of Voltaire and Rousseau and Montesquieu and Diderot, talking of liberty with your friends in cafes. Yours was not among the names that history would remember from that era, but you once attended a salon in a rich woman's house in Paris. You were not part of the mob that stormed the Bastille in 1789, but you felt your heart leap when you heard the news, because you knew that now everything would change. When you read the terms of the Constitution of 1791, you saw the fulfillment of your youthful daydreams become the solid fabric of a new reality. Imagine, then, standing in 1815, a quarter century after the Revolution, looking back at what it had all become. That first bright rush of freedom had given way, first to the murderous insanity of the Terror and the Committee for Public Safety, then to the thuggish new imperialism and endless bloody wars of Napoleon, and finally to the fall of all Europe to conservative reaction under the Congress of Vienna. Imagine looking back on the arc of your beliefs, your movement, and your life, now as an old man, with no prospects for another, better Revolution ahead of you. Would you think your dreams had failed? Would you decide that everything you had believed had been an illusion, and that freedom, democracy, and the Rights of Man were false idols that led only to chaos and bloodshed? If so, you would be utterly wrong . The two centuries after 1815 would see the ideals of the early French Revolutionaries continue to advance across the world - unevenly, in fits and starts, and with many reversals, yet almost always leaving society better off than before. Those centuries would also see plenty of successors to Robespierre and Napoleon, but just like th",

I strongly suspect that if I ignored my conscience and actually sold these prompt packs, I would make the promised $1,000.

This is Claude Code at work, one of a new generation of AI coding tools that represent a sudden capability leap in AI in the past month or so. What makes these new tools suddenly powerful is not one breakthrough, but a combination of two advances.

He's said that the technology can transform society for the better, and herald a new industrial revolution that will make us all more productive, more secure and more equal. But the former British prime minister isn't just an AI evangelist advising governments on how they should use AI. He's now getting in on the tech bro act himself. We can today report that Blair's eponymous think tank has been spending heavily on developing its own AI tools that it hopes to sell to governments in what insiders describe as a bid to \"rival Palantir\". Democracy for Sale and Lighthouse Reports have spoken to dozens of current and former staff at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change over the past year as part of our investigations into the influence of Big Tech on government. Multiple sources confirmed that TBI has set up a new in-house \"AI Incubator\" in a bid to \"get on the AI bandwagon\", while cutting staff in other areas and posting financial losses. TBI was made aware of all points in this article prior to publication but declined to comment. Democracy for Sale is a reader-supported publication. If you aren't already, consider becoming a paid subscriber to support us. The AI Incubator, where top earners reportedly make up to &#163;370,000, is developing tools to help political leaders make decisions, with plans to sell them to governments clients, particularly authoritarian Gulf states, according to insiders. The move has caused internal concern, with some saying it is \"insane\" for a non-profit to try to compete with major tech companies. But \"Blair sees the Incubator as his legacy,\" one former employee said. Senior leadership at TBI are said to be hoping that the AI Incubator, which was launched last Spring, can transform the non-profit entity into a tech company.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told a room full of editors and news CEOs this week that OpenAI will prioritize selling AI to businesses in 2026. Altman lunched at Rosemary's Midtown with leaders from The Atlantic, The New Yorker, The New York Times, and other top national publications on Monday. The conversation, wide ranging and at times unwieldy, featured a charming and disarming Altman speaking candidly about himself, his business, and plans for the coming year. He even fielded a question about whether he felt like Oppenheimer from New Yorker editor David Remnick. Altman's plans for OpenAI's enterprise push was the biggest revelation from the lunch, details of which multiple people with knowledge of the discussion relayed to me. Under Altman, OpenAI has excelled at building consumer products, with ChatGPT approaching 900 million weekly users. But the company has faced fierce competition when selling its AI models to businesses, primarily from Anthropic , which is leading the enterprise AI market. At the lunch, Altman made clear that selling to enterprises was a massive OpenAI priority, and mentioned that it was an application problem, not a training problem, that the company needed to solve. Altman was straightforward about OpenAI's need to build better products for enterprises and his intent to fast track them. Subscribe now For OpenAI, growing its enterprise business could be the surest way to scale revenue as it pursues one of history's great infrastructure buildouts. Enterprise AI is the fastest growing software category in history, expected to bring in $37.5 billion next year , according to Gartner, up from almost zero in 2022. Should OpenAI make inroads in the category, it could more easily justify new funding rounds and better support its push to build $1.4 trillion of computing infrastructure in the coming years. Notably, OpenAI's October agreement with Microsoft , which added some distance between the companies, gives it greater leeway to build for enterprises. A",

They need at least 25-38 grams. That gap matters more than you think. When nutrition conversations start, protein sells, carbs confuse, fat rebrands and fiber works. And that's exactly what we are going to be talking about today. Fiber. Yep, we know how thrilling that is for our readers. Fiber provides structure to plants, acting as a kind of skeleton, because it's located in their cell walls. When consumed, fiber remains intact as it moves through our digestive system since we lack the necessary enzymes to break it down. That might sound... useless. But that trip through your system is exactly what makes fiber so valuable. As it moves along, it supports digestion, helps regulate how food is processed, and contributes to overall health in ways that extend far beyond the gut. In other words: fiber isn't fuel. It's infrastructure. &#128993; Two Types of Fiber, Two Important Roles Fiber isn't a single thing, it's more like a tag team, with each member handling a different assignment. These are known as soluble and insoluble fiber. Soluble fiber dissolves in water and forms a gel-like substance. If you've ever stirred oats into liquid and watched everything thicken, you've seen soluble fiber in action. Insoluble fiber doesn't dissolve-instead, it absorbs water and adds bulk, more like the sturdy, stringy parts of celery. Together, they keep digestion moving along at the right pace... not too fast, not too slow. Plant foods naturally contain both soluble and insoluble fiber. By contrast, animal products such as meat, dairy, fish, eggs, and oils contain no fiber at all. Different jobs, same goal: keeping the system running smoothly. &#128993; Fiber, in Action Fiber's real work starts after the meal, most of its impact happens in the digestive system. Soluble fiber takes a slower, more strategic approach. By forming a gel in the stomach, it delays how quickly food empties into the digestive sys",

Cylinder seals sit at one of the sharpest intersections in early Mesopotamian history: image-making as governance, craftsmanship as credential, and repetition as a technology of trust. In the late fourth and third millennia BCE, as southern Mesopotamian institutions expanded the scale of storage, rationing, and labor coordination, small carved cylinders became disproportionately powerful instruments. Rolled across wet clay, a seal could secure a door, close a jar, mark a shipment, or authorize the movement of barley, animals, and textiles. It could also bind a person to an action in a way that outlasted speech, memory, or presence. Long before writing became a medium for narrative literature, seals helped create a world in which transactions had to be made legible across distance, time, and changing personnel. In that sense, cylinder seals are not merely art objects that happen to appear beside early tablets; they are part of the same communication infrastructure that made complex administration possible in the first place. The seal's significance begins with its portability and with the way it miniaturizes institutional authority into something that can travel. Early writing and sealing emerge most visibly in contexts where goods are being gathered, counted, and redistributed, and where the integrity of containers and claims must be protected against both accident and manipulation. A proto-cuneiform tablet in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, for example, records a distribution of barley while also carrying seal impressions whose imagery evokes elite control and sanctioned action, including hunting dogs pursuing wild boars. The tablet's dual character is crucial. The numerical and commodity notations present one kind of administrative meaning, while the seal impressions perform another, signaling authorization and oversight in a visual register that does not require literacy in proto-cuneiform signs. In this configuration, the seal acts like a portable institution; i",

Beyond these more eye-catching features, there's also the reputation of the Dutch character: direct, no-nonsense, thrifty and partial to a dry humour that doesn't always translate. In essence, they're thought of as a well-organised, clever and sensible bunch. And with one of the best standards of living in Europe, they tend to be assumed to be doing things generally right. It's because of this renown for competence and control that people within the country as well as onlookers abroad are particularly unnerved by a situation unfolding in the country at the moment. The Dutch, it appears, have sleepwalked into a situation where their digital ID platform - critical infrastructure for a variety of government and private processes - will likely soon be in the hands of US big tech and, by extension, within the potential scope of US government control. * This article is also available now in audio format on the TDTM podcast.

I watched it from my phone, with my children safe indoors and unaware. My daughters still don't know about the attack on the Capitol. They are at an age where it would be&#8230; difficult to explain, provoking far too many questions for which there are no satisfying answers. They know instead that Donald Trump is the President, and that we do not like him very much, and that we wish the other candidate would have won. My youngest asked recently how much longer he would be President, and I told her \"three more years\" with a certainty that she did not notice I did not feel. I find myself thinking today about an old essay I wrote. It was titled \"Afflicting the Comfortable.\" It appeared in an edited volume on the Media and January 6th . Academic writing proceeds at a glacial pace. I drafted the essay in 2022, as a contribution to a conference held on the one-year anniversary of the insurrection. I edited it in 2023, and the book was published in March 2024. As with much of my writing, the essay glances both forward and backward. It was, functionally, a warning left unheeded. Here are the bits that matter (mostly from the introduction, with a bit of the conclusion): There have to be consequences. If we are to stave off the next insurrection, it is essential that the people who planned the last one face social sanctions. If January 6, 2021, becomes a badge of honor or a pathway to profit and power, then we seal the collective fate of the nation. We can approach the problem of preventing the next insurrection from three main angles. We can focus on the mass public -the Republican Party-in-Electorate, a majority of whom now tells pollsters that they believe Trump won the 2020 election despite all evidence to the contrary.

Once a leader in cashless \"innovation,\" Sweden is now actively reversing course to preserve cash. In 2023, it abandoned plans for an all-digital e-krona and is prioritizing payment system safety, while its Defense Ministry-citing vulnerabilities in electronic banking to potential cyberwarfare-distributes brochures advising households to keep at least a week's supply of banknotes on hand. Meanwhile, Switzerland's Liberty Movement is making progress toward enshrining cash in the constitution . But emerging circumstances prove the importance of continued vigilance in 2026. Let's dive in. Sweden's Cash Inquiry In recent years, Sweden has been a pioneer in digital payments, and mobile apps like Swish have dominated transactions, to the point where Sweden is one of the two countries in the world (along with Norway) with the lowest amount of cash in circulation (as a percentage of GDP). In 2024, however, amid rising concerns over cybersecurity threats, power outages, and geopolitical instability, Swedish officials did an about-face and launched a \"Cash Inquiry.\" One of the central proposals to have emerged from the Cash Inquiry is a requirement to accept cash for the sale of essential goods and services . This requirement would apply to supermarkets and other businesses and organizations providing essential goods, and entities like health centers that charge fees under public law. Sweden's central bank, the Riksbank, supports this measure as crucial, with Riksbank Governor Erik Thed&#233;en stating in a press release that \"People should always be able to pay for food, healthcare and medicines both digitally and with cash.\" In its submission to the country's Cash Inquiry, the Riksbank has strongly advocated for legislative measures to protect ph",

Photo by Jakub Zerdzicki from Pexels: https://www.pexels.com/photo/donut-with-icing-and-sprinkles-23203429/ The human body is extraordinarily complex, with several openings and a few exits. But exactly how many holes does each person have? It sounds like a simple enough question to answer - list the openings and add them up. But it's not quite that easy once you start considering questions like: \"What exactly is a hole?\" \"Does any opening count?\" And \"why don't mathematicians know the difference between a straw and a doughnut?\" Before we start counting, we need to agree on what constitutes a \"hole.\" Katie Steckles , a lecturer in mathematics at Manchester Metropolitan University in the U.K. and a freelance mathematics communicator, told Live Science that mathematicians \"use the term &#8216;hole' to mean one like the hole in a doughnut: one that goes all the way through a shape and out the other side.\" But if you dig a \"hole\" at the beach, your aim is probably not to dig right through to the other side of the world. Many people would think of a hole as a depression in a solid object. But \"this isn't a true hole, as it has an end,\" Steckles said.

But as soon as those two digging projects joined up, the Channel Tunnel became a fundamentally different object (what Arthur and engineers would call a \"through hole\") - like a straw, or a tube with an opening at either end.

There's a particular kind of discomfort that has crept into North American life over the past decade or so. But it's only really post-pandemic that it's become impossible to ignore. Life doesn't just feel more expensive, it is more expensive. The basic cost of living, from rent to groceries, going out to car payments has all gone up. Some things take more effort, or feel like that in a realm where we were promised it would be frictionless. And what used to be an option, is now often an obligation. We tend to describe this as a set of separate problems. A cost-of-living crunch, a housing crisis, a public safety challenge, constant congestion, the hollowing out of neighborhoods. Not to mention this insistence that we must now \"return to the office\" , delivered with the tone of a Victorian school headmaster who has mistaken obedience for productivity. These aren't individual failures, they're symptoms of an interconnected system that is now chafing against the people living in it. The system worked too well North America suffers from a long tail of an era of innovation that worked too well. From the mid-20th century onwards, we built cities as very efficient growth machines. The logic was simple &#8230; single-family suburban homes, financed at scale, paired with private automobiles, manufactured domestically and financed just as aggressively. It was a consumer lifestyle, built deliberately. You live there, drive to work, drive to the shops, drive the kids to school or sports practice, drive to the movies, drive well, everywhere. Single-family homes on neat plots were easy to value, easy to finance and easy to replicate all over the continent. They turn land into legible collateral and households into reliable mortgage payers. From a financial point of view, they're a dream. Cars solved a coordination problem too. They allowed cities to sprawl without heavy investment in shared transport. It was seen as better for growth if every household bought a couple of domestical",

The constant pursuit of \"more\" replaces contentment, causing people to feel spiritually unfulfilled, anxious, and driven by a \"need, greed, and speed\" mentality, where one thing is never enough, leading to cynicism and transactional relationships. And like most diseases worth fearing, it scales. What happens in locker rooms also shows up in corporations. And governments. And predatory empires. When systems grow large, complex, and energy-rich with very high energy demands, the incentive shifts from cooperation to capture, from sustaining the whole to strip-mining it before someone else does.

I have a lot of ideas about this. But because I teach small writing classes, I don't have much direct practical experience to draw on. Moreover, I think the kinds of alternative grading that suit large classes best are not the kinds of grading I typically practice. While collaborative grading can work in large courses (my forthcoming book features a few people who have done it!), it's not a great fit for every instructor. That's why I'm thrilled today to share some wisdom from colleagues who are making alt grading work in these contexts. I've been following the work of Jayme Dyer, Katie Mattaini, and Eden Tanner (who teaches at my own institution) for a while now. Each one of these instructors are using innovative grading methods in their STEM courses, often with many students at once. In this guest post, they have some advice for others who would like to explore the possibilities-just in time for spring semester planning. So you want to try alternative grading. Maybe you're intrigued by the promise that Alternative Grading can improve student learning and students' relationship to learning. Maybe you're tired of students gaming the system, seeming to focus more on their grade than their learning. Maybe you want to spend less time hating grading and more time helping students learn. Whatever brings you to Alternative Grading, you want to give it a try. The problem is that you teach large classes. How do you implement alternative grading at scale? In this post, we propose guiding principles and suggest concrete recommendations to help you design a grading system that better supports your students within the constraints of large class sizes.

I think of this as basically a \"tabula rasa\" bet-start with a blank agent and bake it in some environment(s) until it becomes smart. Of course, as we all know now, this didn't actually lead to general intelligences-but it did lead to superhuman agents within the task distribution they were trained on. At this time, people had started experimenting with a different approach, doing large-scale training on datasets and trying to build models that could predict and generate from these distributions.

It's an Air America \"Huey\" flown by a civilian contractor. Another helicopter, a Marine CH-46, came along soon after and evacuated the few Marine guards who were left guarding the embassy.

Google this morning announced the rollout of Gemini , its largest and most capable large language model to date. Starting today, the company's Bard chatbot will be powered by a version of Gemini, and will be available in English in more than 170 countries and territories. Developers and enterprise customers will get access to Gemini via API next week, with a more advanced version set to become available next year. How good is Gemini? Google says the performance of its most capable model \"exceeds current state-of-the-art results on 30 of the 32 widely-used academic benchmarks used in LLM research and development.\" Gemini also scored 90.0% on a test known as \" Massive Multitask Language Understanding ,\" or MMLU, which assesses capabilities across 57 subjects including math, physics, history and medicine. It is the first LLM to perform better than human experts on the test, Google said. Gemini also appears to be a very good software engineer. Last year, using an older language model, DeepMind introduced an AI system named AlphaCode that outperformed 54 percent of human coders in coding competitions. Using Gemini, Google built a next-generation version named AlphaCode 2. The sequel outperformed an estimated 85 percent of humans, the company said. Competitive coding is meaningfully different from day-to-day software engineering in some important ways: it can be both more and less difficult than what the typical engineer is asked to do. But still, the rate of progress here is striking. Gemini is natively multimodal, meaning that it can analyze the contents of a picture and answer questions about it, or create an image out of a text prompt. During a briefing on Tuesday, a Google executive uploaded a photo of some math homework in which the student had shown their calculations leading up to the final answer. Gemini was able to identify at which step in the student's process they had gone awry, and explained their mistake and how to answer the question correctly.",

Having us long for the next grand adventure we can take, hoping that will be the one to build a connection that lasts. These types of moments, the grand moments in nature, have their place.

Here are my hunches about the year ahead: Photo by Matt Walsh, via Unsplash: https://unsplash.com/photos/text-tVkdGtEe2C4 By late spring/early summer, Trump's governing coalition will be consumed by infighting. This won't lead to anything dramatic like impeachment proceedings or invoking the 25th Amendment. But one of the critical differences between Trump's first and second administrations is his ability to quell any intra-party opposition. Basically no one within the party network has been capable to stand up to him this time around. 1 They have purged the ranks of the DOJ and the FBI and the military. The sole governing value that unites the Republican Party of 2025 is we agree with President Trump . The ability to maintain that party unity is one of his few relative strengths. But, as Henry Farrell has argued, this sort of party unity is brittle. Absolute power can be a terrible weakness. Here's how it looks to me, right now: Trump's approval rating currently hovers around 40%. The macroeconomic situation is dicey. Neither will improve in 2026. And, as we draw closer to election day, Republican leaders are going to panic and start blaming each other. Trump's team will not deal well with dissension in the ranks, so things are likely to get out of hand. That infighting will be a blessing, because the more time they spend fighting each other, the less bandwidth they have for attacking the rest of us. This doesn't mean we are out of the woods yet . Russ Vought and Stephen Miller are going to treat this year like a clearance sale on consolidating their fascist power grab. The Supreme Court majority will be even more brazen in trying to lock in election-proof permanent majority status for the Trump regime. Still, assuming relatively normal el",

(Photo by Jim WATSON / AFP via Getty Images) On Monday, Popular Information reported that the U.S. military raid that removed Venezuelan President Nicol&#225;s Maduro from power could be a financial windfall for Paul Singer, a Trump-supporting billionaire. Singer, through a company called Amber Energy, purchased Citgo, the U.S. subsidiary of Venezuela's state-run oil company. The sale of Citgo was forced by creditors, including Singer, after Venezuela defaulted on billions in government-issued bonds. Citgo owns significant oil refining capacity on the Gulf Coast of the United States and other assets. An advisor to the court that oversaw the sale estimated that Citgo was worth about $13 billion. But Singer was able to purchase Citgo for a substantial discount, $5.9 billion, because those refineries are purpose-built for Venezuelan heavy crude. (The sale still must be approved by U.S. regulators.) The U.S. embargo on Venezuelan oil forced Citgo to purchase oil from more expensive sources in Canada and elsewhere. The U.S. military operation in Venezuela would benefit Singer if it meant Citgo could acquire Venezuelan oil. Less than a week after the military raid, Venezuelan oil is on its way to the United States. On Tuesday evening, Trump announced on Truth Social that Venezuela would be \"turning over\" between 30 and 50 million barrels of oil. The heavy crude will be \"brought directly to unloading docks in the United States.\" The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump's announcement was \"good news for Gulf Coast refineries that are configured to run heavy crude including from Venezuela.\" At the top of that list is Citgo, a company designed to process Venezuelan oil in the U.S. Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that Citgo \"may emerge as one of the biggest beneficiaries of President Donald Trump's plan to bring millions of barrels of the country's oil to the US.\" Energy Secretary",

It is the meeting point between an artist's body, a medium's physics, and a viewer's habits of attention. Yet brushwork is also where some of art history's most stubborn myths gather; that the visible stroke equals sincerity, that smoothness equals conformity, that speed equals genius, that finish equals virtue. A serious account of touch has to hold two truths at once. First, the surface really does carry information about process; pressure, sequence, revision, and the negotiations between intention and contingency. Second, the meanings we attach to those marks are cultural constructions that shift across time, place, and institutional demand. Facture names the manner in which something is made: the work's material \"how,\" not just its visual \"what.\" As the National Gallery of Art's journal title implies, facture is concerned with making as an interpretive category rather than a purely technical one, because how a work is constructed is inseparable from what it can mean (National Gallery of Art, Facture). In conservation writing and close-looking pedagogy, facture is often treated as the visible trace of production, the made-ness that persists even when the image aspires to illusion (MIT Press Reader). Style, by contrast, is a set of recognizable conventions of appearance and articulation (shared solutions, inherited problems, and learned accents) while finish describes the degree to which a surface has been brought to a chosen state of resolution, whether that resolution is glossy, matte, textural, abraded, or deliberately left open. In practice, these three categories overlap, but separating them helps students avoid a common error: confusing a look (style) with a procedure (facture), and confusing a procedure with a value judgment about completion (finish).

That shift surprised me, because for a long time virtual try-on felt inevitable. Garments already exist in 3D. Brands want to reduce returns. Customers want confidence. The logic seems airtight. But after spending more time inside real fashion workflows and going deeper into real-time rendering and interactive systems, I've come to a different conclusion: anything short of true photorealism doesn't meaningfully outperform a high-quality photo or a well-crafted digital twin when it comes to purchase confidence. And the gap between where mobile real-time tech is today and where it would need to be to fully close that loop is still massive. What has caught my attention over the last few years, though, is something else entirely. It's quieter. Less talked about in traditional fashion circles.

These aren't niche experiences. They're massive, social, identity-driven worlds where self-expression matters and clothing and skins are one of the primary ways people express themselves. In Fortnite, cosmetics aren't an afterthought. They're central to the experience. Players spend real money to customize how they look, not because it helps them win, but because it helps them be seen. Epic's leadership has said it plainly: Fortnite is fashion. And the numbers back that up. Fortnite has generated tens of billions of dollars in revenue almost entirely through cosmetic purchases. Players routine",

    "text": "Exploring the Knives Out Universe Are they just entertaining murder mysteries or something more? During the holiday season I watched Wake Up Dead Man and rewatched the previous Benoit Blanc mysteries: Knives Out and Glass Onion , which collectively give us the KOU (Knives Out Universe). The films operate as Agatha Christie style whodunits, but also engage in some deeper themes, and it is for this reason I wanted to write about them. Wake Up Dead Man addresses those themes in greater depth than the first two movies, while also illuminating the core values across the series. If you are unfamiliar, the original Knives Out (lets call this I) was a classic country house murder mystery about an avaricious family fighting over the inheritance of a successful writer that one of them may have killed. Glass Onion (II) is centered around a Greek Island retreat hosted by a tech billionaire, one of whom is a murderer. In Wake Up Dead Man (III) a bombastic priest is killed in a church in rural New York. *Many spoilers ahead.* The movies are connected by the Benoit Blanc, played by Daniel Craig, although one other actor appears in all three movies. See if you can remember who; I will share at the end of the post. All three movies are written and directed by Rian Johnson. So what are the components of the KOU? Consider becoming a free or paid subscriber! A good-hearted naif is thrown into the wolves In I, Marta is a home-help provider who inherits the estate of the wealthy patriarch she took care of, leading the family to threaten and cajole her into returning the fortune, while one of them tries to frame her for murder. In II, Helen Brand is an Alabama schoolteacher seeking to unmask which member of a jet-set group killed her sister, and in III, Fr. Jud is a good-hearted priest in a hostile parish that accuse him of murdering his senior colleague, Monsignor Wicks. Benoit Blanc is as much a counselor to these babes-in-the-woods as he is a detective. He stops Marta from renouncing her inheritance. He drags Fr. Jud away before he can confess to a crime he has not committed. He c",

When inflation rises, entertainments are often cut from budgets or become luxury expenses that happen rarely. Affordability is not just about the price of eggs, beef, or gas. Americans like to have fun. Most Americans work 40-hour weeks and get 2-4 weeks of vacation days a year with some holidays thrown in. We are bombarded with pop culture wisdom about work-life balance. If some Americans tip the scales towards entertainment rather than work, there are many small businesses that exist to cater to these life-is-short folks. However, it seems that inflation is hitting the events people use to decompress after work rather hard. Dining out and ordering in: According to Barmetrix, \"Key Takeaways Restaurant prices are rising faster than groceries-guests notice it, and so will your margins. Since 2019, food and labor costs have each gone up more than 35%, while utilities and swipe fees keep climbing. Raising prices alone won't solve it; profitability depends on smarter systems and discipline. Operators who manage costs, engineer menus, and protect the dining experience will come out ahead. Guests feel it first at the table. As of August 2025, prices are up 3.9% year-over-year-well above grocery prices at 2.7% . Full-service restaurants have taken the biggest hit, with menu prices rising 4.6% . At the same time, overall guest traffic still hasn't returned to pre-pandemic levels. For many operators, that means the only realistic way to cover higher input costs is through menu price increases. Chains likeWaffle House have nearly doubled menu prices-but independents don't have the same brand power or scale to cushion those hikes. A regular who once ordered their go-to entr",

After her death, Good was subjected to a vicious smear campaign. A picture of Renee Nicole Good is displayed near a makeshift memorial for Good, who was shot and killed at point-blank range on January 7 by an ICE agent. (CHARLY TRIBALLEAU / AFP via Getty Images) On January 7, Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother and U.S. citizen, was fatally shot by ICE agent Jonathan Ross in Minneapolis. After her death, Good was subjected to a vicious smear campaign by the President, the Vice President, administration officials, and their allies. The baseless attacks against Good are a coordinated, brazen and callous government propaganda effort. The goal is to convince Americans to believe an official narrative over objective evidence - including video of the incident. It is an ongoing campaign to legitimize the homicide of an American based on misinformation. Meanwhile, the FBI is blocking state law enforcement from conducting an independent investigation while selectively leaking information to partisan outlets. Minnesota officials are calling it a cover-up. Trump: Good \"violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer\" In a January 7 post on Truth Social, Trump claimed that Good \"violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer.\" This is objectively false. Videos taken by witnesses show that the first shot into Good's vehicle occurred while Ross was standing in front of the vehicle as Good turned the wheel to avoid him. The second and third shots occurred while Ross was standing to the side of Good's vehicle . There is no evidence that Good's car even touched Ross, much less ran him over. In the post, Trump claimed it was \"hard to believe [Ross] is alive.\" In a video, Ross stays on his feet throughout the incident and is seen walking toward Good's car, which crashed, after the shooting. The Department of Homeland Security says Ross went to the hospital and was released, but there is no documentation of any specific injuries. Trump repeated this claim to New York Times reporters that same day. \"[Good] behaved horribly,\" T",

Hot on the heels of yesterday's look at where Season 7 of Everything Is Amazing took us - here's where we're going in the next season, and during the six weeks leading up to it. When I was a kid, I fell hopelessly in love with a children's adventure novel my late father gave to me: Brothers Robin, John and Harold are waiting for their parents to return from India and suffering under the stern guardianship of their Aunt Ellen - and during the Easter holidays from their boarding school, Harold catches measles. Having missed the window for returning to school for the next term and facing the profound existential horror of spending months ( months! ) with Aunt Ellen, the three boys pack their bags, steal some food and their father's rifle and some ammunition, and decide to go live in the woods as outlaws. (At this point Robin, of course, renames himself \"Robin Hood\", John as \"Big John\" and Harold as \"Little John\".) Hijinks naturally ensue. They build a shelter within a hollow oak tree, they eat whatever they can forage, kill & cook, and start wearing rabbit-skin coats after their clothes wear out. (I can't remember how many rabbits this involved, but of course there's somewhere on the Internet that calculates stuff like this, and it must be hundreds. ) After 8 months of evading capture by the fun-ruining adults of the local police force, the intrepid trio heroically turn themselves in to save the life of a loner they've befriended in the woods - just in time to meet their father, to explain themselves in a way that makes him proud, and presumably to celebrate with lashings of ginger beer. It's that kind of story. The story ends with an escaped bear they encountered earlier in the story, finding their hollow oak tree and settling into it to hibernate away the coming winter. Brendon Chase was published in 1944, but is set in earlier, seemingly simpler times, with all the wistfulness you might expect from a book written during one of the most violent social co",

    "text": "Large Language Mistake  Current AI models are not on the path to artificial general intelligence Paywalled? (Doesn't matter, reprinted below!) Well! Last week was an unexpectedly exciting one here at Cognitive Resonance HQ (aka my house) after The Verge published my essay explaining why large-language models are not on the path to general intelligence, because language is not the same as thought. Forgive the crowing, but if I may: Yann LeCunn, the outgoing chief AI scientist at Meta, posted about it favorably on LinkedIn; Alison Gopnik, a cognitive scientist I've long admired, described it as \"excellent and very clear\"; and I picked up more than 200 new followers to this newsletter-welcome, y'all! 1 (Yes, I live in Texas. Yee-haw.) Given this interest, I thought this week I'd address two of the main critiques of my argument. Before continuing, if you need to build some background knowledge on this topic, the entire essay is re-published below (with The Verge 's permission)-and regular readers may note that it borrows liberally from several previous essays published here, including my interview of neuroscientist Ev Fedorenko (more from her later). But now let's get into the pushback. Basically, we've got two groups of people who think I'm very mistaken about the future of AI, although interestingly their critiques are diametrically opposed to each other. I'm calling the first group the \"wing flappers\" and the second the \"cognitive pluralists.\" The wing flappers believe that my argument fails because I mistakenly assume that the only way to get to artificial general intelligence is by emulating human intelligence. \"Cutting-edge research shows airplanes do not work the same as birds, [so] the entire airline industry is a bubble ignoring this,\" said someone on Reddit, thinking they zinged me but good. The theory here seems to be that because there's so much data that's used to train LLMs, perhaps that's sufficient in and of itself to achive general intelligence. \"Written language stores thought,\" wrote one particularly aggravated commentor on The Verge , \"so LLMs a",

    "text": "The Price of Denial Early Warnings, Arrogant Dismissal, and the Lingering Cost of COVID's Immune Legacy There have been a recent number of articles framing the immune harm from Covid as a new insight. While I am pleased this has entered the mainstream, I am afraid it is too gracious to the lagging scientific consensus of how covid has been wearing away at our immune responses. Especially given how when I raised this based on T cell phenotypes, I was dismissed and attacked with extreme prejudice. Reframing Covid's immune harm as a new insight rather than a long-fought hypothesis contrary to 'immunity debt' achieves several aims: 1) It deemphasizes the role in propagating false narratives that several individuals had along with choice medical journals. For example, the BMJ extensively platformed Alasdair Munro's claims of the 'immunity debt' hypothesis. When an editor was approached with a proposal for how covid was harming immunity by individuals who had published in the BMJ before and myself, they refused to accept it. 2) It saves face for the individuals who staunchly attacked the hypothesis and dismissed it as a joke. Those people also strongly attacked me, and they would go on to claim that it is my fault such a false and ridiculous narrative of immune harm from covid even existed. These are lay people but also others. 3) it preserves a semblance of credibility for the established sources who previously denied the hypothesis and obfuscated it. 4) It shirks accountability for the duty of discernment, consideration, and equipoise that stewards of information and knowledge, like the BMJ, had to the public. They had access to the hypothesis and rationales previously and chose to trounce on it and dismiss it with extreme prejudice. To me, it highlights how many of the experts were ill-equipped to grasp early immunological changes and project them to their outcomes. This was not just an oversight, it was an editorial choice. The author of the BMJ article, Nick Tsergas, confided that the editors wanted to avoid controversy and drama. They wanted to whitewash its history. ",

Trump flags fly as rioters take over the steps of the Capitol on the East Front on Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021. (Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) Five years ago today, on January 6, 2021, a violent mob stormed the Capitol building. Following the attack, over a hundred major companies released statements condemning the insurrection and promising to stop donating to the 147 members of Congress who voted to overturn the 2020 election, or to halt all political donations entirely. Since returning to office, President Trump has continued to push false claims that the 2020 election was \" rigged ,\" \" stolen ,\" and filled with \" fraud .\" On Trump's first day as president, he issued sweeping pardons and commutations for some of those involved in the Capitol insurrection. In a presidential action, Trump wrote that the pardons and commutations ended \" a grave national injustice .\" The current members of Congress who voted to overturn the 2020 election have embraced Trump's return to the White House. None has expressed any regret for their vote. Nevertheless, most companies that pledged to stop donating to these lawmakers have broken their promise. After January 6, 2021, for example, a Cigna spokesperson gave CNN the following statement: There is never any justification for violence or the kind of destruction that occurred at the U.S. Capitol last week &#8211; a building that stands as a powerful symbol of the very democracy that makes our nation strong. Accordingly, CignaPAC will discontinue support of any elected official who encouraged or supported violence, or otherwise hindered a peaceful transition of power. Cigna, however, has since donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to lawmakers who voted to overturn the election. In April 2021, a spokesperson for the company told the New York Times that resuming donations to members of Congress who voted to overturn the election did not violate its pledge because congressional voting is \"by definition, part of the peacef",

Behavior Power by Bart Fish & Power Tools of AI / Better Images of AI / CC by 4.0 A 22-year-old has an earnest query for her AI chatbot: \"How do I really impress in my first job interview?\" To which the AI helpfully responds, \"First, you need to think about your clothes and what they communicate about you and your qualifications.\" Now, is this sound advice for kicking off a productive career-coaching session - or is it sponsored content? What if her AI was incentivized to steer such a conversation toward clothing because fashion retailers generate more ad revenue than career counselors? How would our earnest job-seeker even know? How would anyone? This scenario reveals something unprecedented about advertising in the age of AI: it can be woven invisibly into the fabric of conversation itself, making it virtually impossible to detect, and very likely skirting the boundaries of fair-advertising regulations as they exist today. Invisible influence Unlike previous technologies that broadcast information to us, AI is designed to engage in a relationship with us . We don't just use ChatGPT or Claude; we converse with them. We share our problems, ask for advice, and increasingly rely on them as thinking partners. The AI product that wins isn't the one with the best answers; it's the one that \"just gets you.\" Among AI developers, this creates what I call the race for context. To be truly helpful, AI needs to understand your goals, your personality, and your psychological tendencies. But the same intimate knowledge that makes AI a perfect assistant also makes it a perfect manipulator. The caring therapist and the skilled con artist draw from the same toolkit of human understanding. And when advertising enters this equation, it seems more likely than not that the con artist will overtake the therapist. While traditional ads are clearly marked interruptions - like TV spots ",

Horrifying footage from Kahrizak Medical Forensic Center in Tehran shows bodies lined up in body bags as families arrive to identify the dead. #&#1578;&#1607;&#1585;&#1575;&#1606; \\\" &#1662;&#1582;&#1588; &#1588;&#1583;&#1607;&#8204;&#1575;&#1606;&#1583;. #Iran \",\"username\":\"Vahid\",\"name\":\"Vahid Online\",\"profile_image_url\":\"https://pbs.substack.com/profile_images/477553911075573760/68_S3x04_normal.jpeg\",\"date\":\"2026-01-11T00:05:44.000Z\",\"photos\":[{\"img_url\":\"https://substackcdn.com/image/upload/w_1028,c_limit,q_auto:best/l_twitter_play_button_rvaygk,w_88/vzja0lolfszdni3ny01d\",\"link_url\":\"https://t.co/0pnOEQQtdS\"},{\"img_url\":\"https://substackcdn.com/image/upload/w_1028,c_limit,q_auto:best/l_twitter_play_button_rvaygk,w_88/eqsd9iup57uaz5f70jlm\",\"link_url\":\"https://t.co/0pnOEQQtdS\"}],\"quoted_tweet\":{},\"reply_count\":189,\"retweet_count\":458,\"like_count\":1402,\"impression_count\":85645,\"expanded_url\":null,\"video_url\":\"https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/2010140454931591169/vid/avc1/352x624/JfALL7qkp4SKX_rO.mp4\",\"belowTheFold\":false}\" data-component-name=\"Twitter2ToDOM\"> According to BBC's Bahman Kalbasi, hundreds of protesters have been killed by the government in the last 72 hours.

An incentive structure that predictably pulls confidential work product into an AI lab’s orbit while delegating the hardest compliance judgments to the least protected people in the chain. \"Scrub It Yourself\": The Ethical Shortcut That Turns Contractors into Liability Shields by ChatGPT 5.2 On January 9, 2026, WIRED reported that OpenAI is asking third-party contractors to upload \"real assignments and tasks\" from current or past jobs-ideally the actual deliverables (Word docs, PDFs, PowerPoints, spreadsheets, code repos)-so OpenAI can benchmark the performance of next-generation \"AI agents\" against a \"human baseline.\" Contractors are instructed to remove or anonymize confidential information and personally identifiable information (PII), with the burden placed on them to decide what must be scrubbed. That setup is not just a procedural risk. It's a moral and governance failure dressed up as an evaluation pipeline: an incentive structure that predictably pulls confidential work product into an AI lab's orbit while delegating the hardest compliance judgments to the least protected people in the chain. What's morally and ethically wrong 1) It externalizes harm onto the powerless while internalizing value for the powerful. If the data is valuable enough to improve or evaluate \"office-work\" agents, it's valuable because it encodes real organizational knowledge: processes, templates, client context, negotiation styles, internal decision logic, and tacit expertise. The program effectively asks individuals-often precarious contractors-to \"donate\" that value from previous employers and clients, while taking on the personal downside if anything goes wrong. This is classic moral hazard: the beneficiary (the AI developer) is structurally insulated, while the risk carrier (the contractor) is exposed. 2) It undermines professional trust and workplace confidentiality norms. Many professions (law, finance, healthcare, consulting, executive support, concierge services, engineering) rely on confidentiality as a baseline ethical commitment-not merely a contractual checkbox.

They sense oxygen and nutrients, send signals that summon repairs, guide growth, and decide when-and where-healing should happen. They're less like pipes and more like diplomats: listening, negotiating, coordinating. Until recently, I carried a similar misconception about bone. Like most people, I thought of it as scaffolding-solid, durable, and largely inert. But bones are neither quiet nor simple. They're alive, fussy, and constantly remodeling. They store minerals and metals, respond to hormones, and stress, and continually rebuild themselves throughout life. They're less like concrete pillars and more like coral reefs-busy, layered, and exquisitely sensitive to their surroundings. How Common-and Costly-Bone Failure Really Is Osteoporosis is far more common , and more dangerous, than most people realize. About one in three women and one in five men over age 50 will suffer a fracture because of it. For women, the toll is especially heavy: over a lifetime, they will spend more days hospitalized for osteoporosis than for breast cancer and heart disease combined. Hip fractures are often the turning point. Within a year, one in four people will die. Of those who survive, many never walk independently again. These aren't rare mishaps; they're predictable failures of a system under long strain. Osteoporosis is often framed as an inevitable disease of aging. But it emerged as a major public-health problem only in the second half of the twentieth century, when longer lives collided with industrialized environments and skeletons shaped by those conditions began to fail in large numbers. What We Still Don't Ask Despite this burden, we rarely ask the most important question: why bones fail in the first place . Research has focused on repairs-drugs to slow bone loss, surgeri",

    "text": "Stephen Stills A Reason To Smile Credit: Getty Images Stephen Stills is a man who has worn many hats. He was a member of two of the most successful folk-rock groups in history: Buffalo Springfield and Crosby, Stills & Nash. He is a singer, a songwriter, a musician, a harmonizer, an arranger, and a producer. He has created rock, folk, and country music. He plays the guitar, bass, banjo, piano, and organ. He famously played every instrument on CSN's first album except the drums. Stills could also be wearing a birthday hat, because he turned 81 on Saturday. For all of this and more he is our reason to smile. Stills wrote dozens of songs for CSN. His last major hit was \"Southern Cross.\" In the liner notes for \"Daylight Again\" he described the song's origins. \"The Curtis Brothers brought a wonderful song called &#8216;Seven League Boots,' but it drifted around too much. I rewrote a new set of words and added a different chorus, a story about a long boat trip I took after my divorce. It's about using the power of the universe to heal your wounds. Once again, I was given somebody's gem and cut and polished it.\" I interviewed Stills, along with David Crosby and Graham Nash, a few years back. Stills talked about the music they made together. \"It's not so much that we were going to change the world. It's that we want to convince everybody that it's possible. And it's not so much that America's sick and dying, it's that it's a beautiful idea that needs to be nurtured. And we're about the joy of making a wonderful noise together.\" Nash went further to describe their \"wonderful noise.\" \"It was absolutely, completely a unique sound. It was one voice made up of three individual strains of voice. There was no doubt. We knew what we had.\" We are all glad they had it and grateful they shared it with the rest of us.

Author's Note / Context Statement for the Kiggans Article This article reflects my analysis and perspective as a practicing nurse who has worked within, and been impacted by, the systems affected by the policies and votes discussed. It draws on publicly available information, professional experience, and pattern-level observations in healthcare safety and workforce impacts. While I have made every effort to ensure accuracy, policy timelines, financial disclosures, and legislative details may evolve over time and should be cross-referenced with official sources for the most current information. This is an informed commentary, not a legal brief or investigative report. Its purpose is to examine how elected officials' decisions shape real-world conditions for patients, clinicians, and communities, and to highlight the ethical implications when credentialed healthcare workers support legislation that causes preventable harm. Readers are encouraged to review source documents directly and to consider this piece an entry point for broader dialogue and accountability. Have you read When Nurses in Power Vote Against Their Oath ? Executive Summary In 2025, Congress passed a sweeping budget reconciliation package commonly known as the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" (OBBBA), which combines deep, long-term cuts to food assistance and public-health coverage with substantial increases in defense, homeland-security, and immigration-enforcement funding. Publicly available analyses of the bill's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) provisions estimate that millions will lose or see reductions in benefits, with roughly 93,000 premature deaths projected between now and 2039 as a direct consequence of increased food insecurity. Independent modeling of the Medicaid provisions projects that several million people will lose health coverage, with an estimated 16,000 additional deaths per year attributable to loss of insurance and delayed treatment for stroke, cancer, cardiovascula",

When he does this, my head slowly rotates toward him like the Chucky doll's. We've talked about this. I'm no better than him at discerning the exact passing of time.

Photo by Alexander Shatov on Unsplash Need another reason to leave X, formerly known as Twitter? If the Great Replacement conspiracy theories and the constant barrage of personal abuse weren't enough, this might tip you over the edge. Elon Musk's AI tool Grok is being used &#8211; en masse &#8211; to generate intimate images of real women and girls, some under 18, digitally undressed and shared online. Victims include celebrities, teenagers, and everyday female users &#8211; and despite the uproar, and mealy-mouthed words from Grok and Musk, the practice appears to be continuing, even as I write this. In a sentence that feels grimly predictable to write: this mass proliferation of sex abuse material has been framed as a technical failure. Loyal to the Silicon Valley \"move fast and break things\" ethos, Grok treated it as a lapse in safeguards, a moderation oversight, something that could be fixed with a technical patch. But this misses the point. This not some malfunction, but true to the platform's purpose: X is a mechanism that strips away our humanity and amplifies society's worst instincts. Racism, misogyny, and sexualised cruelty were not invented by social media, but they are increasingly defined by it. Anonymity, algorithms, and consequence-free posting do more than allow harmful attitudes to surface; they reward their performance.

Image via Unsplash: https://unsplash.com/@jpvalery A list of short reactions that I desperately feel the need to get off my chest: Elon Musk's trillion-dollar pay package . I mean&#8230; Sure, whatever. Matt Levine had a good take on this yesterday , before the vote. If you are still at Tesla investor in November 2025, then you are pretty much by definition an Elon stan. Tesla is a meme stock with a price/earnings ratio hovering close to 300. The new payment plan only kicks in if Elon transforms Tesla into a $8.5 trillion company. That's going to be hard to do, on paper, with declining car sales and an utterly pretend product line of personalized Optimus robots. People on Bluesky were saying last night that he'll never reach the pay package because it is a failing, flailing company. And I would like to agree with them, but I worry that these folks are underestimating the degree to which money - particularly stock market money - is all fake now. I think it's entirely possible that, over the next 5 years, Tesla sales will continue to decline, and the Optimus robots will be a Cybertruck-scale nonstarter, while, simultaneously, the company becomes a world-leading innovator in shady market manipulation and semi-fraudulent accounting techniques. By November 2030, Tesla might just be fifteen circular funding deals in a trenchcoat - cash-poor and on the verge of insolvency, but also nominally valued at $8.5 trillion, granting Elon his performance bonuses. Bookmark this for the next three years at least: it's only accounting fraud if we have a functional administrative state and courts willing to enforce the law.

In addition, the cases reported in 2025 significantly exceed the average and maximum numbers of reported cases in the years 2018 to 2024. The most cases of hepatitis A in 2025 were reported by the capital city of Prague (1376 cases), the Central Bohemian Region (471 cases) and the Moravian-Silesian Region (261 cases) Of the total number of 3256 cases reported in 2025, 2514 people were hospitalized in the infectious disease ward (77.2%). Among those who died last year were thirty men and six women, aged 35 to 82. Most of them had chronic liver disease or engaged in risky behavior, such as drug use or alcohol addiction. \"The risk of severe disease and death increases with age and is higher in people with chronic liver disease or weakened immunity,\" the institute added. Until 1965, hepatitis epidemics in the former Czechoslovakia recurred every year. After that, the hygiene level gradually improved, especially in connection with the availability of safe drinking water and the expansion of the sewage system. The overall trend in the development of hepatitis A morbidity in the Czech Republic has been decreasing since the mid-1960s; The exception was a large-scale foodborne epidemic in 1979, when the number of reported cases exceeded 32,000. The last increased incidence of viral hepatitis A in the Czech Republic was recorded in the 1980s; the number of cases ranged from approximately 1,500 to 3,500 cases per year. In the 1990s, the number of reported cases continued to decrease; an average of 870 to 2,080 cases per year were reported. Thanks for reading Outbreak News Today!

It lays out exactly why sleep is so thunderously important to our health, and how quickly and how completely we fall apart without it. Forward we go to sleeplessness and horror - accompanied by a gruff, British voiceover from the idiot who writes this newsletter. When I first started writing for a living, my head was filled with a lot of damn-fool notions about writing - the kind you'd never hear from a highly accomplished veteran, but you would hear from someone on social media whose only body of work was a loud, desperate-sounding need to appear authoritative. Since I was learning to be Extremely Online a lot quicker than I was learning to write, I internalised a lot of those confidently wrong ways to become A Proper Writer. One of these was around intentional sleep deprivation, to stimulate the imagination. It's true that as you push far beyond your normal sleep cycle, you reach a point where you're hallucinating on your feet. Woah! Wouldn't that be a good source of really imaginative and out-the-box thinking? suggested the person whose tweet I can't now find, probably because they're now either deceased or working in investment banking.

Eventually, you stumble a bit.\" To this point, Avatar: Fire and Ash has earned about two-thirds of what Avatar: The Way of Water did through its first month, allowing for the possibility that another Disney title - Zootopia 2 - could end up as the studio's top global earner from 2025. \"Kudos to Disney,\" Sean McNulty says of the company's success, noting the rewatch factor for Zootopia 2 remains extremely high based on its $10.1 million gross during its eighth weekend of release. \"If you think KPop Demon Hunters has been on in your house for a long time, Zootopia 2 will probably be doing that in the second quarter of this year.\" Elsewhere in this episode: The Housemaid continues to clean up (as Richard notes, the death of Sydney Sweeney 's box office viability has been greatly exaggerated) and Primate takes down Greenland 2 among new releases.

    "text": "Goodbye 2023!!! Read to the end for a good belly rub video I Am So Annoyed I Have To Write This After today, I'm going dark until the first week of January. If you need me, I'm reachable on email and I'll be lurking in the Discord, as well. The plan was to make today's issue a fun round up of stuff everyone liked in the Garbage Day Discord. And that's here too, further down below. But, unfortunately, it doesn't just get to be a bunch of fun stuff because Substack has, once again, stepped in it. I put a version of what I'm about to say here in the paid issue over the weekend, but after stewing on it - instead of enjoying the holidays!!!! - I decided I should put this in the main issue, as well. Substack's co-founder Hamish McKenzie posted a real bad statement this week about the platform's Nazi problem. A bunch of writers I respect are leaving the platform and I think I will be, as well. To be clear: I don't want to move actually. Substack, at least as a product, works incredibly well and there are lots of good people working there who have been super helpful over the last few years. But I don't think it's worth staying there anymore. I've tried to make the case a few different times as to how Substack should moderate themselves. I don't even think it's that complicated. But it goes nowhere and they clearly don't care. And so, at this point, I'm just annoyed. Substack is, essentially, my primary business partner and their pathological need to virtue signal to the worst people in the world is exhausting. And I am, frankly, sick of waking up every few months to deal with the fallout after they release a statement that pisses off all my readers. To put this in language they seem to value (more than moderation), they are, increasingly, making it harder to do business with them. Not only do they refuse to enforce literally their own terms of service, but they also can't stop blogging about it. If I had a chief technology officer who was constantly posting about people's right under the first amendment to sell Nazi memorabilia I w",

    "text": "Housing Policy Is Inequality Policy A new paper shows how credit rules, rents, and supply interact to shape who wins and who loses 100% written by a human. For most households, housing is their biggest asset and their biggest expense. Ireland's overall home ownership rate is around 69 to 70 per cent as of 2024, and falling. Historically the rate peaked above 80 per cent in the early 2000s and hit a low near 68.4 per cent in 2014. Ownership varies sharply by age cohort. In 2023 the ESRI found close to 80 per cent of those over 40 own their home. Only about one-third of adults under 40 do. This generational gap is one of the largest in Europe. The struggle to access housing, and in particular ownership in housing creates two distinct groups when it comes to wealth accumulation. Historically housing served as the store of wealth in Ireland, but it has always been unequally distributed. Now thanks to the introduction of pension auto-enrollment, we can see two stores of wealth emerging. Housing policy is always understood as part of inequality policy and yet we still analyse housing tools one at a time, as if credit rules, supply, landlords, and taxes operate in isolation. In the real world they do not. A new paper just published in the Journal of Housing Economics by Simone Cima from the Central Bank of Ireland and Joseph Kopecky from Trinity College builds a life-cycle model of renters, owners, and landlords calibrated to Ireland. (A life cycle model is just that-it follows households from early adulthood to their retirements. Across that life cycle decisions households make around incomes, borrowing, saving, owning, and renting affect the shape of their wealth, consumption, and perforce inequality between households). It is a cool paper that asks one question: What actually happens to inequality once prices, rents, and tenure choices adjust together? Their central finding is simple. The distributional effects of housing policy depend critically on credit conditions. Subscribe now The same policy can look progressive under loose credit and regressive under tight credit. Effects are not additive. Y",

I've written seven articles on 1 Timothy 2:11-15 and referenced that passage in several more. I've written about many other passages often used in the debate over whether God ordains a hierarchy of men over women, but until today, I haven't touched the passage that would seem, in a \"plain reading of the English text,\" to be the ultimate \"clobber\" verses, 1 Corinthians 14:34-35. Women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the law says. If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. The reason for my delay is simple: credible complementarian scholars do not make as much of this text as they do 1 Timothy 2, and for good reason: they know the passage cannot mean what it seems to mean on first reading, because it would not only contradict Paul's own theology in other letters but within this very letter, which permits women to pray, prophesy, speak in tongues, and otherwise not \"remain silent in the churches.\" To say women can prophecy is to say they can preach, as I showed in \"Women Can Preach Because New Testament Women Prophesied. \" Beyond this, cautious advocates for male authority know that 1 Corinthians is a can of worms, with its call to wives to \"have authority\" over their husbands' bodies (in a passage promoting mutuality, which spells the end of hierarchical marriage claims unless \"man is head except in bed\" ). But what do we make of 1 Corinthians 14:34-35? We know what it can't mean, but it's hard to know all that it did mean. John Walton has famously said, \"The Bible was written for us, but it wasn't written to us.\" Paul wrote these words 2000 years ago in an ancient language to people he'd had many previous conversations with (Acts 18:1-18), and to whom he'd sent at least one previous letter (1 Cor. 5:9). We can know the larger point: that church services should be orderly and respectful rather than a cac",

    "text": "George Monbiot And The Question Of 10 Billion Population, Scale and Consequences Photo by Mark Flanagan on Unsplash I believe that inaccurate information about the environment is not merely irresponsible-it is deadly in the most literal sense. When the scale and urgency of environmental damage are misunderstood or downplayed, meaningful action is delayed or dismissed, and the consequences fall on living ecosystems. Whales wash ashore with stomachs full of plastic because the true magnitude of our waste is obscured or normalized. Species populations collapse within decades when reality is ignored or misrepresented. Entire marine ecosystems are turned into dead zones as intensive fertilizer use continues unchecked. In each case, I believe that inaccurate narratives don't just confuse the public-they enable inaction that results in real, measurable harm. Photo by NOAA on Unsplash My film, GREENWASHED , for example, highlights the plight of Pony, an orangutan used in a brothel whose story caused massive outrage (understandably so). In contrast, however, each year our demand for palm oil and other vegetable oils increases (in large part because, as our human enterprise grows, so does our demand for foods, detergents, soaps, fuels and other things that use vegetable oils). This predictably results in mass deforestation, burning and suffering of orangutans, separation of their families, and horrific deaths of untold numbers of these highly intelligent, beautiful primate individuals. However, this broader harm doesn't seem to cause nearly the level of public outrage as the story of Pony does. Photo by Simone Dinoia on Unsplash Like all other species with whom we share this world, orangutans have every right to exist and evolve on this planet. But they get burned, displaced and killed en masse, all because-well, because if every year our demand for oil crops grows, then someone will supply those oil crops.

Some 125,575 pages have been made public so far - and DOJ announced that there were 5.2 million remaining pages being vetted by 400 lawyers. Epstein, a wealthy financier and one-time friend of Donald Trump, abused thousands of underage girls, yet with the help of powerful friends his crimes were long ignored or minimized. Share When I ran The Fact Checker, original source documents were the gold standard for the verification of facts. But how can anyone make sense of this stash of material - which will total more than 1,700 linear feet, higher than many skyscrapers? The answer is AI.

It's the internet garbage you know and love, but in a format that's easier to read while you consume undisclosed ads on X, the everything app. ( X.com/SHL0MS ) PLATFORMS MrBeast's X video (not a porn thing) is being promoted as an undisclosed ad, except not exactly. It's showing up in people's videos without a label, which has led many to believe X was breaking the law. But I spoke to an X employee about this and think I understand what's happening here. There is a pre-roll ad from Shopify in front of MrBeast's video. X's pre-roll feature is called Amplify , and when a post contains a video that has an Amplify ad in it, the post is boosted like an ad, but without the label. Because technically, MrBeast's post is not the ad and thus doesn't require one. The ad is the Shopify pre-roll, which is correctly labeled as an ad for users who press play. This would also explain all the other not-an-ad boosted posts you're seeing. The ad is loaded in front of the video inside of the post. Get it? Bluesky dropped their moderation report. My interest in Bluesky ebbs and flows, but I really appreciate how pragmatic they're being about moderation. Their central philosophy seems to be that giving users more mod tools alleviates some of the pressure on a social network's trust and safety team. I'm watching this closely because it's possible that that's true. It's also equally possible that this approach is the digital equivalent sweeping bad content under the couch.

    "text": "A History of the Present A History of the Present is The Intellectualist series tracing how contemporary institutions evolved beyond human scale and away from human needs. A History of the Present For nearly all of human history, the world made sense at the scale of a face, a voice, a shared meal. Then our systems grew faster than our biology. This essay traces how abstraction, acceleration, and scale reshaped civilization-and how institutions built to serve humans slowly became forces humans now struggle to understand, govern, or escape. The future is still open. But the margin for error is thinning. Beyond Human Measure (2026) visualizes the condition explored in A History of the Present : a world in which human perception still registers order and intention, even as the systems shaping life now operate at scales no longer legible to the humans living inside them. (Made with AI using DALL&#183;E.) Civilizations rarely collapse all at once; they fail when the systems that once made sense no longer fit the humans living inside them. It has become common to describe the present as a moment of crisis. The word appears everywhere-attached to democracy, climate, technology, and war-until it begins to lose its force. What distinguishes this moment is not simply the number of problems we face, but the way so many of them appear to be failing at once. Institutions that once absorbed stress now amplify it. Technologies designed to increase efficiency generate instability. Systems built for growth strain under their own scale. What feels like chaos is often something more specific: institutions now operating at a scale humans were never built to navigate. What is at stake is not whether the world will change-it always has-but whether the systems shaping daily life remain legible, governable, and aligned with human needs. For most of our existence, that misalignment did not exist. This Substack is reader-supported. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.

Created using OpenAI's ChatGPT image generation feature Since Coupang &#8211; often called the Amazon of South Korea &#8211; disclosed a massive leak of its users' personal data last November, the American tech company has come under heavy fire in Seoul. Though an unfamiliar name in the U.S., the company has led Korea's e-commerce market for years, anchored by its \"Rocket Delivery\" service, which is now ubiquitous among Koreans. The incident triggered National Assembly-led inquiries and hearings that grilled company officials throughout December, while Korean American founder Bom Kim &#8211; who serves as CEO and chairman of Coupang Inc., which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) &#8211; declined to appear, fueling public anger. Against this backdrop, the revelation that a former Chinese developer at Coupang was behind the leak, coupled with the company's unilateral release of its investigation findings &#8211; allegedly without coordinating with Korean authorities probing the matter &#8211; introduced a new complication and further deepened the rift between the American e-commerce giant and the Korean government. Now, with multiple complaints and lawsuits piling up and a government-wide \"Coupang Task Force\" established, the company faces enormous pressure in Seoul beyond remediating the data leak, including scrutiny over tax, labor, and competition practices. This heated dispute risks bleeding into U.S.-Korea trade relations, particularly given Washington's persistent pushback on Seoul's moves to regulate online platforms, foreshadowing a wider digital trade conflict between the allies.

From the start, the AI beat felt more fast-paced than anything I had covered in more than two decades as a journalist, writer, and editor. Then, when OpenAI released ChatGPT that November, everything accelerated. And since then, the sheer velocity of new products, infrastructure, research, companies, investments, societal shifts, geopolitics, and policy battles has only kept climbing-week after week, month after month, year after year. Just this week, for example, the AI news cycle felt nearly impossible to keep up with. I began with a story on the AI chip startups sitting pretty after Nvidia's Groq deal-work I'd done before New Year's-then rushed to cover Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's CES keynote and OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT Health. Meanwhile, my inbox kept exploding with pitches from top companies and investors. The flood of smart, provocative posts on social media-each pointing to a story I might want to chase-felt almost crushing. By Friday, I felt a kind of burnout no one should experience just one week into a new year, when you're supposed to still be coasting on holiday energy. I know I'm not alone in this. I didn't speak directly with any of my AI reporting peers this week. But as I watched (and envied) them share scoop after scoop on companies like OpenAI, xAI, Anthropic, and Google; report from the frenzy of the robotics and semiconductor scene at CES; try to make sense of the seemingly endless stream of announcements from Big Tech's marketing machines; and parse the cryptic posts and reposts of figures like Elon Musk, I began to wonder: How sustainable is all of this for anyone trying to do real journalism? Last April, a fellow AI reporter invited me to join a group chat called the \"AI journalism support group,\" with about a dozen members.

    "text": "How Trump Is Harming Federal Childcare Funding A court shut down his five-state freeze-for now-but his \"defend the spend\" policy is still a recipe for chaos. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) LATE ON FRIDAY, a federal judge blocked the Trump administration's funding freeze on federal childcare funding going to five large Democratic-led states . The judge's order came in response to a lawsuit filed by the five affected states-California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, and New York-and could be overturned either upon the resolution of the lawsuit or upon appeal, should the Trump administration choose to contest the decision. Friday's order does not affect another recent policy move by the administration relating to childcare: putting in place new administrative requirements with far tighter restrictions before funds can be disbursed, ostensibly as a way of combating fraud. In practice, though, this move will likely not noticeably reduce fraud but may cause delays in states getting childcare aid out the door. If one doesn't understand how the U.S. childcare system works, that may not seem like such a big problem-but the harmful ripple effects will go far, far beyond the directly affected families. Let's start with some background. The high cost of childcare-families using licensed programs often pay over $10,000 a year per child-is a result of the fact that it takes many adults to care for young children. Adult-to-child ratios are kept low (often one adult for every six toddlers, with different ratios for different age groups), which means fixed personnel costs are high. Even with many staff members making poverty wages, childcare programs often operate with paper-thin margins and little to no financial cushion. At the same time, lower-income families cannot afford the fees; the families of some 1.4 million children rely on federal childcare subsidy vouchers. This creates a precarious balance: When states have trouble getting voucher reimbursements out in a timely manner, or when subsidy funding is unavailable, childcare programs struggle to make payroll or pay rent and may have to close their doors. This scenario has playe",

    "text": "One Courageous Correspondent What happened inside \"60 Minutes\" this weekend Credit: Michele Crowe/CBS CBS News \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi is walking the walk. What she has done for journalism in the last two days is about as important, and courageous as it gets. With her cherished journalistic institution threatened, and her career on the line, Alfonsi is sounding the alarm that \"60 Minutes\" is sliding further into an increasingly irretrievable and dark place. The Steady team spoke to sources inside the broadcast today to find out exactly what happened when the new CBS News boss, Bari Weiss, spiked a highly promoted piece at the last minute. On background, we learned that Alfonsi and producer Oriana Zill de Granados had for months been working on a story about the Trump administration's illegal deportations of Venezuelan migrants to CECOT, a maximum-security prison in El Salvador. They interviewed former inmates about the brutal and torturous conditions inside the notorious prison. This is the place where Trump sent hundreds of Venezuelans he alleged were terrorists with gang ties. Human Rights Watch found that the 252 men were subject to \"arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance.\" As part of the reporting, they repeatedly asked the White House, the Department of Homeland Security, and the State Department for comment, but received no response. That is no surprise since this story would be another black mark on Trump's draconian immigration agenda. Last Thursday, after the story had been fully fact-checked and legally vetted by CBS lawyers and its Standards and Practices team, the piece was screened for a fifth and final time for CBS News executives. Weiss was supposed to attend but did not. She did, however, screen the story several hours later. At 11:50 p.m. Thursday, Weiss emailed the broadcast's executive producer, Tanya Simon, outlining a few issues she had with the piece that she called \"incredibly powerful.\" On Friday morning, Alfonsi made several changes to the script to address Weiss's concerns, believed it was",

This week, our president announced that he would like the nation's defense budget, which already stands at $1 trillion, to be increased by $500 billion, or $600 billion. It's hard to know which is the real number, because he changes the amounts whenever a new whim is making its way through his excellently-focused mind. I refer to Donald Trump' mind as excellently-focused, because he emphasizes it all the time. He has claimed to have \"aced\" a simple cognitive test that is regularly administered to aging adults by geriatric physicians. During an interview with four reporters from the New York Times on Thursday, Trump allowed them to listen in as he conversed on his speakerphone with Colombian President Gustavo Petro. Afterwards, Trump made a point of asking the Times reporters if they thought Joe Biden \"could do that.\" This conversation took place days after Trump called Petra an \"illegal drug leader\" and a \"sick man\" and warned that he might be kidnapped \"next\" after he had kidnapped Nicolas Maduro and his wife from their home in Caracas, Venezuela. Trump is very determined these days. He is especially determined to bring the world to heel. He told the New York Times reporters, who must have been clutching the arms of their White House chairs in astonishment, that he doesn't \"need\" international law. Asked if there were any limits on his powers over the world, Trump responded, \"Yeah, there is one thing. My own morality. My own mind. It's the only thing that can stop me.\" Trump currently has one trillion dollars in his defense budget &#8211; I guess these days he would call it his \"war budget\" since he and Hegseth have renamed the Department of Defense as the Department of War &#8211; to fund attacks he wants to carry out on various enemies such as Houthi rebels in Yemen, alleged nuclear facilities in Iran, the Islamic State in Somalia, and more recently, 36 so-called \"drug boats\" in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean, and the country of Venezuela.

My role is to manage our Distributed Organizing program, meaning the ways supporters can get involved with the party at a national level, empower volunteers to become leaders, and share the responsibilities of organizing our communities to win elections. Last spring, we rolled out our principles of organizing , centering our efforts on the organizing tactics that we know work, cut through the noise, and prepare us for the future. Since then, the DNC's Distributed Organizing and Technology teams have been testing new tactics, tools, and planning for the future. Now, 2026 is here, and it's time to take what we've learned and roll out new programs, continue to test new tools, and build energy ahead of November. 2025 Distributed Program Learnings In 2025, the Distributed Organizing Team tested how to scale non-traditional voter contact without relying heavily on traditional relational organizing tools. Through our People's Network programming, we trained over 500 supporters to organize within their own networks, resulting in more than 6,000 conversations with friends, neighbors, and community members, over coffee, online, and at local events. At the same time, DNC volunteers made more than 1 million traditional voter contact calls, including Get Out the Vote efforts and redistricting pressure campaigns in states like Texas and Indiana. Our biggest learning: Scaling non-traditional voter contact types takes time, dedication, and buy-in from supporters, who may be used to jumping on a phone bank, but are less accustomed to engaging neighbors or friends in deeper conversations. Along with testing tactics, our team worked to pilot a number of new organizing tools, selected from our 2025 Organizing RFP process, to support those tactics both with organizers in the states and with our distributed organizing team nationally.

    "text": "Debunking the Institutional Theory of Economic Development Steve talks with Erald Kolasi about why “good institutions” don’t explain why some countries prosper while others struggle. Click the image to listen and read along on our website Steve welcomes back Erald Kolasi, physicist-economist, author, and friend of the podcast. Erald is here to do a demolition job on \"institutional\" development fables like Acemoglu & Robinson's Why Nations Fail . He argues that by treating good institutions as the master key (inclusive vs. extractive) they smuggle in a liberal moral scoreboard while dodging the real motors of history: power, class struggle, imperial systems, and material constraints like energy, trade dependence, war, and ecological shocks. To \"steelman\" Acemoglu and Robinson's position, Erald uses their favorite showcase case &#8211; North vs. South Korea. He lays out their comparison of the \"tyrannical dictatorship\" vs the \"open\" society and presents their explanation for these differences. Erald then flips the script: the DPRK outperformed for decades, then crashed not because its \"institutions got worse,\" but because the USSR collapsed. Cheap, subsidized energy disappeared, wrecking agriculture and triggering famine. The pattern repeats across history. Using examples like China and Venezuela, the episode explores how wars, sanctions, resource access, and global power structures shape economic outcomes far more than abstract institutional rules. Development is a struggle rooted in material conditions and geopolitical realities, not a neutral competition between better or worse policy designs. Erald Kolasi is a writer and researcher focusing on the nexus between energy, technology, economics, complex systems, and ecological dynamics. His book, The Physics of Capitalism, came out from Monthly Review Press in February 2025. He received his PhD in Physics from George Mason University in 2016.

    "text": "Bill Gates's stunted political vision Bill Gates went full Lomborg. Never go full Lomborg. There is a stunted type of political vision that can only ever imagine the world getting better through the cognitive largesse of the power elite . This vision begins from the bedrock beliefs that (a) there is a social hierarchy, (b) it is basically meritocratic, and (c) it produces a rising tide that lifts all boats. The cognitive largesse can take two forms. (1) Geniuses can innovate, gifting us with new technologies or business ideas, or (2) Geniuses can make large, magnanimous gifts to the less-fortunate. If one buys into this political vision, then it stands to reason that you should never do anything to make the rich and powerful uncomfortable. Taxes and legal restraints and unions just slow them down and make them feel less generous. The path to building a better world necessarily runs through the better angels of their nature. (I wrote about all this in my 2020 essay about the Clock of the Long Now . It'll also be in the forthcoming book.) In 2021, Bill Gates wrote an entire book titled How To Avoid a Climate Disaster . He took seriously that climate change was a generational threat. The better angels of his nature were up to the challenge. And he indicated in the book that he knew this would be a long, hard slog. It has only been four years. By some measures, we have seen remarkable progress. The cost of renewable energy has plummeted. If we just have the political will to prevent fossil fuel companies from extracting market-bending favors, the trajectory of the energy sectors would look pretty damn promising right now. But the politics of 2025 couldn't be much farther from the politics of 2021, particularly in the United States. The Trump Administration has declared climate change a hoax. They are defunding scientific research and canceling already-existing clean energy projects. They are weaponizing the IRS to pursue political enemies, a list which includes the climate movement.

This is the reason why practically no one who votes for the Democratic Party actually likes the Democratic Party.

The Democrats were \"winning\" the comms fight over the shutdown, but that's a borderline-pyrrhic victory. Trump doesn't care about his popularity, and he doesn't care about Republican electoral losses a year from now, and he doesn't care about mass suffering and loss. The guy went to the Supreme Court with a demand that he let him starve 40 million Americans. That's both terrible substance and terrible optics! And still the theory-of-change here is \" well we hope that the electorate blames Trump and the Republicans for this, and keeps blaming them for another year, and then votes in such record numbers that they give the Democratic Party a slim majority in the House and Senate. \" That's the best near-term theory-of-change available. But I keep looking around and thinking \" yeah but that's not nearly up to the task.\" The government shutdown was pretty much bound to end this way. At some point, the squishiest members of the Senate Democratic Caucus were going to to get too uncomfortable with all the pain and suffering for their constituents. They were going to ask \"is this worth it for what we have demanded?\" And they would eventually decide \"nope, not anymore it isn't.\" The alternate possible outcome would have been Senate Republicans perma-nuking the filibuster.

    "text": "A Telluride Film Festival tribute: Endings Gangsters Can’t Escape Gangster films remind us that power built on fear always ends in isolation, silence, and an unavoidable reckoning. Watching John Woo's Hard Boiled today, one is struck not by its impossible body count but by its operatic clarity: a world where chaos reigns because systems meant to protect people have been hollowed out from within. Chow Yun-fat's Tequila is not a vigilante fantasy so much as a moral constant, moving through corruption with a code the institutions around him have lost. If there's a mob-syndicate feeling to modern governance, Hard Boiled reminds us that the answer isn't more bullets, it's accountability, discipline, and law reclaimed by those sworn to uphold it. Woo's ballets of gunfire are metaphors, not manuals: a visual language expressing what happens when order collapses and conscience is forced to improvise. Woo didn't invent this grammar out of nowhere. You can see the lineage clearly, Bruce Lee's The Big Boss gave him the kinetic ethic, the idea that physical action could be moral expression. From there, Woo absorbed the nervy realism of The French Connection and the classical toughness of Howard Hawks' original Scarface , long before Pacino turned it operatic. These films weren't celebrations of crime; they were warnings about power left to rot. The guns never stop firing because the systems never stop failing. For modern audiences, especially younger generations raised on spectacle without subtext, Hard Boiled can be overwhelming. But beneath the flying doves and endless magazines lies a sobering lesson: when institutions abandon restraint and clarity, chaos fills the vacuum. Woo's Hong Kong isn't lawless because cops are weak; it's lawless because rules have been compromised. That's where the film speaks to now, not as a call to arms, but as a call to restore boundaries. If there's a contemporary takeaway, it's the importance of local law, civilian oversight, and clear chains of accountability, the unglamorous work that prevents the need for cinematic heroics in the first place.

MODERN MYTHS Into the labyrinth Technology and mythology meet when E.S. Northey, a PhD student focused on Cornish folklore, takes a tour of an AI data center. A Folklorist Visits a Data Centre - in The tour began in the basement, under the earth, where I could feel the thrum of London Tube lines. Here, massive generators hummed in readiness, kept at a just-so temperature so they might start more quickly if needed. Beneath my feet, deeper still, sealed in concrete, lay reservoirs of diesel fuel the size of swimming pools. Enough to run the entire facility for two weeks. They wait unused. They are redundant, only in the case of a UK-wide grid outage. My tour guide seemed proud as he rattled off numbers relating to capacity, wattage, and voltage. We travelled upward by staircase and lift and wound our way through a labyrinth of corridors, atriums, canteens, offices, and eventually into the server halls themselves. I was shown around sealed chambers where GPU racks stood in ordered rows, their blinking lights creating constellations of green, red, and amber. It was a liminal space of compute density and void space. The temperature shifted dramatically as we moved between zones. From the sharp heat radiating from the machines to the arctic chill of the cooling aisles, where the air conditioning fought its battle against entropy. My tour guide, leaning on a GPU rack, talked about uncertainty and redundancy, backup coolers, backup heaters, backup generators, backup backups. Overhead, cable trays held thousands of wires, rivers of power cables as thick as your forearm, fibre optics all bundled and colour-coded. Pipes and vents ran along the ceilings and walls.

    "text": "Elite Colleges Should Try Harder to Stay Elite They remain wildly expensive while doing less than ever to prove their worth. This combination is not sustainable. Dear readers, Rose Horowitch wrote last week for The Atlantic about the explosion of disability designations at elite colleges and universities, mostly granted to students with mild and increasingly common psychiatric diagnoses like anxiety, depression and ADHD. Officially, 38% of Stanford undergraduates are registered as disabled, as are a third of those at Amherst and more than a fifth at Harvard and Brown. As the proportion of the student body that is designated disabled has climbed at these universities, so has the number of students who receive academic accommodations - most commonly, permission for extra time on exams. And while students who receive academic accommodations in middle and high school lag their un-designated peers in reading and math scores and are moreover less likely to attend college, this is not true for college students, many of whom had no history of such a designation before they enrolled in college. Horowitch cites the research of Robert Weis, a psychology professor at Denison University, who studies these trends: When Weis and his colleagues looked at how students receiving accommodations for learning disabilities at a selective liberal-arts school performed on reading, math, and IQ tests, most had above-average cognitive abilities and no evidence of impairment. And that, of course, gets at a major reason why so many students are suddenly \"disabled\" - it gives them a leg up, academically, in a supposedly elite, achievement-measuring environment. 1 A college education is supposed to both build human capital and send a signal about human capital to employers. The explosion of accommodations is one of several forces that are simultaneously undermining elite colleges' value on both of those dimensions: Admissions standards at many schools have gotten less rigorous. This is because many universities have made standardized testing optional for applicants; in some cases, colleges will not even consider standardized test scores that students vol",

    "text": "The One Simple Thing That Makes the U.S. Economy Unmanageable We used to be able to answer the question \"How much does that cost?\" But prices in America are not only high, but increasingly hidden. Fortunately, there's pushback. In 1956, CBS launched a new game show, The Price Is Right, in its daytime schedule. Contestants were presented with various objects, and the one who guessed closest to the actual retail price would win. The Price Is Right became the longest running game show in American history, because it spoke to a very casual yet deceptively important social question: How much does it cost? There's an important political assumption behind that question, which is that every retail item has one single price. And any buyer anywhere in America can pay that price to acquire it. Americans might have had different amounts of money, but they were all equal in that they paid the same amount for the same good. While a single price in a market might seem a natural state of affairs, and economists love presenting simple supply and demand curves assuming as much, there's nothing natural about it. In fact, a dense network of laws and norms created the notion of a single price for all buyers and sellers in a market, aka, The Price Is Right society. We no longer live in such a society, because the legal framework behind a single public price for an item has fallen apart. There are many examples, but the easiest way to understand this change is to look at health care markets, where hiding prices, and the consequences thereof, is most advanced. There Are No Real Prices In Health Care A few days ago, Hunterbrook, a short-seller funded media outfit, released an investigative report showing what looks like a multi-billion dollar money laundering operation by the three largest health insurance companies. The allegation is that CVS, UnitedHealth Group, and Cigna are supposed to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies for lower drug prices for their patients. But instead, they collude with those pharmaceutical companies to force higher drug prices, and split the profits with them. It's not a new charge.

Produced by Ankler Media executive producer of brand experiences Jennifer Laski, the series is presented by Apple Original Films & F1 . For filmmaker Joseph Kosinski , realism is paramount when it comes to making blockbusters - and it's clear from his recent output, including best picture nominee Top Gun: Maverick and last year's global smash F1 , that audiences agree. But for the Apple Original Films hit starring Brad Pitt , Kosinski, director of photography Claudio Miranda and the actors upped the ante. Shooting at actual F1 races around the world, the filmmaking crew often had less than 15 minutes to shoot one or two scenes at Grand Prix events ranging from Las Vegas to Abu Dhabi. In Vegas, it was a track that had \"no safety margin.\" If Pitt and co-star Damson Idris made any mistake, Kosinski says on the latest episode of Art & Crafts: Under the Hood , \"they would go right into a concrete barrier.\" During regular filming schedules, the actors and crew have 15-25 takes to get it just right, but at official F1 events, Kosinski would go to his cast and say, \"We'll probably get two takes, maybe three at this.\" He compares it to live theater - at a budget and scale much higher than any play. \"When you have the right cast, and you have the right crew, the pressure of those situations, I feel, brings out the best,\" Kosinski says. \"You have 150,000 people in the stands watching. You've got all the F1 teams around you &#8230; Those are moments that I think, when I look back, I'll never forget.\" Related: How F1 Captured Brad Pitt Driving 200 MPH in a Formula 1 Racer Set in the world of Formula 1 racing, F1 centers on Sonny Hayes (Pitt), who returns to the sport 30 years after a massive crash derailed his career to bring a struggling team and its hotshot new driver (Idris) to glory.

To add to the magical feeling, I then managed to build production software on my phone: I set up Claude Code for Web by connecting it to my GitHub, which let me instruct the Claude mobile app to make changes to my code and to add/run tests. Claude duly created PRs that triggered GitHub actions (which ran the tests Claude couldn't) and I found myself reviewing and merging PRs with new functionality purely from my mobile device while travelling. Admittedly, it was low-risk work and all the business logic was covered by automated tests, but I hadn't previously felt the thrill of \"creating\" code and pushing it to prod from my phone. This experience, also shared by many others, suggests to me that a step change is underway in software engineering tooling. In this article &#8211; the first of 2026 for this publication &#8211; we explore where we are, and what a monumental change like AI writing the lion's share of code could mean for us developers.

All of them agree that it was a brilliant military operation, which Secretary of State Marco Rubio insists on calling a law enforcement \"mission in support of the Department of Justice.\" Which I guess isn't that far-fetched a description, given the fact that we have platoons of armed, uniformed men in full combat gear running around our own country conducting Gestapo-like law enforcement missions on unsuspecting people, immigrant and citizen alike, as they go about their business of living peaceful lives in the United States of America. What the poohbahs are wringing their hands about is the what-comes-next stage of things, which they are already referring to using the dread terms \"regime change\" and \"nation building,\" both of which are anathema to red-hat wearing true believers of Trump's America. Reading the Washington Post story this morning, \"Rubio takes on most challenging role yet: Viceroy of Venezuela,\" is like reading a new Pentagon Papers written by academic moles who have been hidden away in the basements of the Cato Institute and the American Enterprise Institute for the last 20 years trying to make sense of How It Could Have Gone So Wrong in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is truly going to be a sport watching them trying to avoid saying \"here we go again\" so they can keep from losing their invitations to MAGA cocktail parties and dinners by pissing off the boss. Some interesting details are emerging. Planning for the Big Moment of the Maduro Kidnapping took place over months, with the final preparations coming just before Christmas as everyone waited on the weather for the right moment to go.

And then there are accidents that change your posture in the world. Mine was a book. Not a cheap paperback I didn't care about. Not a throwaway object. A book I wanted badly enough that I'd hunted down a particular version of it, because in my head the edition mattered, the country mattered, the lineage mattered. The first English (British) edition of Letters from Hell, Vol. I , by M. Rowel. A book published in its native land under a pen name, then carried into England under another, M. Rowel , as if the work itself kept changing coats to get through the door. I was living in Mukilteo , just north of Seattle, Washington, and I was in my downstairs personal library , early spring evening. That hour where the light feels like it's leaving reluctantly, and everything you own looks a little more serious because night is coming. It wasn't a bindery then. It was just a room full of books and the quiet belief that loving them was enough. And then I dropped it. I didn't open it like it was indestructible. I didn't crack it wide and disrespect it with confidence. I just&#8230; dropped it. The moment stretched into that classic slow-motion nightmare: the brain suddenly overclocked, watching gravity do its job with a cruelty that feels personal. It wasn't even a clean, honest fall. It was theatrical, like the book had jumped from my grasp, like something unseen had shoved it, like a rum-infused poltergeist had decided to introduce itself by targeting the most fragile thing in the room. A string of expletives left my lips before it even hit the carpet. Then it hit. And what happened next is the sound you only learn once: Not the thud. Not the impact. The failure . The frail cloth binding exploded at the spine , exposing cheap newsprint lining-the kind you see in mid&#8211;19th-century bindings, and bare signatures where the sewing had popped apart like a snapped tendon.

A reality check on protein requirements, labeling loopholes, and a review of Mel Robbins’ protein shot. &#9;BongkarnThanyakij/Getty Images If you are like me, you have probably been inundated with content about protein in the news, on podcasts, and on social media, all extolling its almost magical benefits. Weight loss, brain health, bone health, muscle health, longevity&#8230;protein can do it all. (But can it do my laundry? I digress). Is everything you put in your mouth filled with protein? WHY NOT? IT IS THE ONE DIETARY INGREDIENT TO RULE THEM ALL. The protein pressure is real, but how much protein do we need? This is a common question, and it's no wonder as in 2025 we approached protein monism, where protein is everything and everything is protein. (Monism is an idea or doctrine where there is only one thing or one kind of thing). Obviously, we need protein. Just like we need fats, carbohydrates, and vitamins, etc. But we also need to enjoy our meals and not feel like life is one big hunt for the next protein bolus that we can hopefully choke down. Let's start with what people really need, because 2025 was filled with some pretty serious protein myths, such as women in menopause need more protein per kg of body weight than anyone else or if you have 20 g or less of protein in a meal that it gets turned into sugar. It seemed like a lot of people were engaged in protein one-upmanship in the fight for attention on social media. The evidence-based recommendation for protein is 1.2-1.6 g/kg/day. This means that someone who weighs 80 kg needs 96-128 g per day. A competitive athlete may need a little more (maybe 1.6-1.8 g/kg/day). It's ideal to divide the protein into three meals, aiming for at least 20-30g per meal, but total protein matters more than timing throughout the day. (There are probably nuances in how protein should be divided up throughout the day for competitive athletes.) In North America, many people fall short on protein at breakfast, so finding ways to get a little extra protein here could help many people meet their protein goals. Elizabeth Ward and H",

As many other observers have recently noted, as crazy as much of 2025 was, while Maladministration II took power and began establishing their fascist coup, things have now changed. If you were looking for the moment when the \"soft\" authoritarianism - as bad as it was - hardened into something undeniably deadly, last week was the week things changed from bad to worse.

    "text": "The Cost of a Missed Climate Opportunity How delaying investment turned climate obligations into a bill When Surplus Is Treated as a Problem There is a recurring pattern in Irish public life that tends to reveal itself only after its consequences can no longer be ignored. When the State finds itself with unexpected political latitude to act, that latitude is treated as something to be restrained rather than exercised, with delay framed as responsibility and hesitation elevated into a governing principle. This pattern treats delay as though nothing is lost by waiting, even in situations where costs continue to build regardless of whether the State feels ready to act, and where commitments fixed in law and tied to clear deadlines ensure that postponement does not buy time but steadily turns into a bill. Climate policy has brought this dynamic into particularly sharp focus. Thanks for reading! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. In the early 2020s, Ireland experienced an extraordinary surge in tax receipts. Corporation tax revenues rose far beyond forecast, driven by a small number of multinational firms and reinforced by once off windfalls placed in reserve. Ministers spoke openly about the dangers of spending too much too quickly, warned repeatedly about overheating the economy, and emphasised the lack of projects deemed suitable for rapid expansion, with the dominant concern being not how to act decisively but how to avoid committing. Obligations That Did Not Wait At the same time, the country was already bound by law to reduce greenhouse gas emissions within a defined timeframe. These were not political aspirations that could be quietly revised, but enforceable obligations overseen at European level. Emissions did not slow while the State debated prudence, and deadlines did not move to accommodate planning delays or legal challenges. Instead of accelerating, delivery slowed across every major front that mattered. Public transport projects were postponed again and again, with rail extensions, metro lines, and light rail schemes spending years ",

US Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. during a Cabinet Meeting at the White House on December 2, 2025. (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS / AFP via Getty Images) There is a massive measles outbreak spreading rapidly in Upstate South Carolina. Already, 111 people, mostly in Spartanburg County, have contracted the virus. People have been exposed to measles at church, in health care facilities, and at schools. According to the South Carolina Department of Public Health, 254 people are currently in quarantine , including 43 children. Dr. Linda Bell, the state epidemiologist, says the measles outbreak is \"accelerating.\" Measles was \" declared eliminated from the United States in 2000 .\" But that is due to the effectiveness of the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine. In Spartanburg County, the immunization rate in schools is 90% , and many large schools have vaccination rates in the low-80s. According to the CDC , \"[o]ne person infected with measles can lead to a dozen other people becoming infected in any community where less than 95% of people have been vaccinated against measles.\" Measles is a dangerous disease. Symptoms of the disease include a high fever, cough, and a rash. In severe cases, the disease can cause \" blindness, pneumonia or encephalitis, swelling of the brain .\" Twenty percent of measles cases among the unvaccinated result in hospitalization and \"between one and three of every 1,000 children who get measles die from respiratory or neurologic complications,\" Forbes reported . Before vaccines became widely available, \" measles was the single leading killer of young children globally .\" As Bell noted, increasing vaccination rates now could slow the spread of measles in South Carolina. \"If people are willing to be vaccinated, receiving an MMR vaccine within 72 hours of exposure has been shown to prevent measles infections,\" Bell said .

You reach for it without thinking. It fits your hand. It does its job. For a long time, SEO felt like that mug. A defined craft, a repeatable routine, a discipline you could explain in a sentence. Crawl the site. Optimize the pages. Earn visibility. Somewhere along the way, that single mug turned into a cabinet full of cups. Each one different. Each one required - none of them optional anymore. That shift did not happen because SEO got bloated or unfocused. It happened because discovery changed shape. SEO did not become complex on its own. The environment around it fractured, multiplied, and layered itself. SEO stretched to meet it. The SEO core still exists Despite everything that has changed, SEO still has a core. It is smaller than many people remember, but it is still essential. This core is about access, clarity, and measurement. Search engines must be able to crawl content, understand it, and present it in a usable way. Google's own SEO Starter Guide still frames these fundamentals clearly. Crawl and indexing remain foundational. If content cannot be accessed or stored, nothing else matters. Robots.txt governance follows a formal standard, RFC 9309 , which defines how crawlers interpret exclusion rules. This matters because robots.txt is guidance, not enforcement. Misuse can create accidental invisibility. Page experience is no longer optional. Core Web Vitals represent measurable user experience signals that Google incorporates into Search. The broader framework and measurement approach is documented on Web.dev . Content architecture still matters. Pages must map cleanly to intent. Headings must signal structure.

    "text": "7 Ways to Reduce Downtime in Your Game More time playing = more fun Nothing kills the vibe of playing a game faster than a player checking their phone while waiting 15 minutes for their turn. As designers, we want our players engaged, leaning in, and plotting their next move&#8230; not counting the patterns on the ceiling. It's one thing for a game to have downtime (virtually every turn-based game will) and admin (it's a necessary part of most games). The goal here is reduce , not remove . Based on my years of playtesting and refining mechanics, here are seven proven ways to slash downtime and keep the momentum high in your next design. 1. Add simultaneous play The most direct way to eliminate downtime is to make a game (or some portion of the core loop) where everyone plays at the same time. Whether it's drafting cards (like in 7 Wonders ) or secretly choosing a movement programmed for the round (like in Colt Express ), simultaneous play ensures that the game scales beautifully regardless of player count. If everyone is busy making decisions at once, there is no waiting. This isn't always possible, of course, since some elements of the game still need to be turn-based. Something like Quacks blends a simultaneous play phase (drawing from your own bag) and a turn-based play phase (drafting ingredients). 2. Create something to engage with when it's not your turn If your game is turn-based, engineer a reason to keep players focused when it isn't their turn. This can be achieved through: Reactive abilities: Cards or powers that can be played during an opponent's turn. Resource harvesting: Players gaining resources based on what the active player does (think Catan or Machi Koro ). Shared information: If an opponent's move drastically changes the board state, players must watch closely to adjust their own strategy. 3. Reduce the number of choices to make on your turn Call it Choice Overload or &#8216;the paradox of choice' &#8211; either way, too many choices leads to Analysis Paralysis (AP).

Flanked by her husband and a gaggle of well-wishers, the blue of her dress still gorgeous after hours of standing and smiling, Buckley grinned as she cradled in her hand the thing every actor dreams of, whether they admit it or not: a gold statue. The fact that the statue is a Golden Globe, an award with a complicated history and some undeniable flaws , is, of course, relevant. But the point is that Buckley looks great holding it, that she gave a gracious and funny televised speech as she accepted her award for best actress in a drama for Hamnet and that Oscar nomination voting begins today - which means the real prize awaits. I spent Sunday night's Golden Globes watching them live with my colleague Christopher Rosen and many of you tuning in to share your own insights or correct me when, say, I couldn't remember any best animated feature winners from this decade.

The short version is that it was a good night for a lot of people, including Buckley and her film Hamnet , which won the best drama trophy at the end of the night and confirmed the hunch I've had all weekend that it's playing very, very well with the L.A.-based industry. I'm not sure that's enough for it to be a true best picture threat against One Battle After Another , which won four awards last night and still looks like a juggernaut, even if Leonardo DiCaprio seems likely",

According to epidemiological data from Saxon State Office for Health and Veterinary Affairs - LUA (Landesuntersuchungsanstalt f&#252;r das Gesundheits- und Veterin&#228;rwesen Sachsen), the federal state of Saxony reported a 61 percent increase in Lyme disease cases in 2025 (2,623). This compares with 1,626 cases reported in 2024. Increases in Lyme disease were also reported in Berlin state, where authorities reported more than 1,400 cases, the most ever seen since the start of mandatory laboratory reporting in 2013. Ixodes ricinus/CDC In Bavaria, Bavaria, 5,469 cases of Lyme disease were reported by mid-December. That was around 1,500 more than in the same period last year. Lyme disease, or Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most frequently reported tick-borne disease in Germany. It is caused by spirochetes of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex and is transmitted to humans by bites of infected Ixodes species ticks. The exact prevalence of Lyme disease in Germany is unknown. In Germany, the reported incidence in the federal states with mandatory reporting varies between 26 cases per 100,000 inhabitants (2015) and 41 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Lyme disease interviews Most infections with B. burgdorferi do not lead to symptoms. If disease does develop, the following organ systems can be involved: skin (erythema migrans, borreliotic lymphocytoma, acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans), nervous tissue (early and late neuroborreliosis), joints (Lyme arthritis), or heart (Lyme carditis). Patients treated with appropriate antibiotics in the early stages of Lyme disease generally recover quickly and completely. This prevents severe illness and late manifestations.

    "text": "Stars Stuff: Previewing San Jose tomorrow, a quick tales from the clipped on Thomas Harley's struggles, and Nill on the trade deadline  Your weekly puck smorgasbord. Yesterday I decided to write about Macklin Celebrini at Sticks and Salvos . He really is a singular talent. I don't think I've ever seen a player with that kind of vision on entry, where he knows everyone's route, and either speeds up or slows down as needed to optimize with pace. Barring an injury, he will make history for production by a player his age. Vinh Cao ( whose work I can't recommend enough ) used a word that I wish I had thought of: inevitable. That's the Celebrini experience . It hasn't been for Dallas, however. Through two games this year versus the Stars, Celebrini has recorded two points and registered only one shot on goal. It got me thinking about who on this Dallas team I would describe as &#8216;inevitable.' I'm not sure that player really exists. Sure, Mikko Rantanen can take over a shift. Jason Robertson can score goals like nobody's business. But who can tilt the ice with an egg timer? While not obvious, I do believe that person exists. It's just my personal opinion but I'd argue it's Miro Heiskanen. Heiskanen, along with Esa Lindell, were the defenders Celebrini saw the most in both games. Of course, how do you measure gamebreaking defense? That's the thing about defense. It's why we debate the merits of Jason Robertson's two-way play. We measure it by its absence. Anyone remember what this team looked like without Heiskanen last season? Or consider the success Dallas has had despite Thomas Harley struggling to look like himself? Not many teams would survive with just a single number one defender to anchor the team defense. Because of that, Heiskanen deserves the spotlight. Whether you agree or not, Dallas has a tough road ahead. Multiple back to backs, and only two gimmies versus St. Louis make this a month that will define the immediate future - the trade deadline, which we'll get into - and long term. I say long term because I think we're about to find out just how much juice this team has in a division where you can't lack a single drop. ",

This is another attempt to construct a dynamic model of the bonds between society and its members. What I am looking for is a way that a user, person such as you or me, would be able to \"instantiate\", or to make an instance of the model in order to \"populate\" it with particular data, and that this data can be \"sparse\", just little bits at a time, if that is all that there is. This might be the \"snapshots\" of perception or understanding that we all have, or it might be objective facts that we have obtained through our research. Here I am making use of a \"dual\" system, two distinct systems, each with their own forms of integrity: objective reality, and subjective experience. The mappings of objective reality conform with those of the sciences, while the mapping of qualia is one of interior, subjective, processes that are \"owned\" by the \"locus of agency and intent\", and are as black boxes to the outside world. It is a dynamic model, incorporating ideas of force, latency, phase and resonance.

Please be patient with typographical errors which may have escaped my edits. I explain to the DeepSeek chatbot: I am interested in dynamic ecosystems where time binding associates the processes owned by loci of agency and intent. In each case perception is governed by two factors: real structures that are imposed from the local context, and scale invariant qualia of perception, which are structured internally to each locus. I am interested in energy transfers between such entities in regard to their relative similarities and dissimilarities. I am interested to describe a set of tensors inherent to this model, and locate loops and nodes of resonance s within some real instantiation of the model.

    "text": "De 10 meest gevolgde Nederlandstalige Substacks En de Nederlandse YouTube-kanalen die in 2025 het vaakst trending waren. Hi, Zoals elk jaar in januari zet ik de populairste Nederlandse creators op een rijtje en maak ik inzichtelijk welke accounts het snelste zijn gegroeid. Dit jaar trap ik af met een nieuwe lijst: de meest gevolgde nieuwsbrieven op Substack. Verder duik ik in de Nederlandse YouTube-kanalen die in 2025 het vaakste in Trending stonden, en eindig ik met wat mij verder deze week is opgevallen op het vlak van creators, social media en tech. Populaire creators op Substack In totaal zijn er wereldwijd acht Substacks met meer dan &#233;&#233;n miljoen abonnees, waaronder The Pragmatic Engineer van Gergely Orosz die in Amsterdam woont. Letters from an American van historicus Heather Cox Richardson staat met 2,7 miljoen abonnees bovenaan. Hoewel content maken niet draait om wie de meeste volgers heeft, vind ik dit soort lijsten zelf altijd wel interessante materie om ervan te leren. Meest gevolgde Nederlandstalige Substacks Bij de Nederlandstalige Substacks staat AI Report met afstand op &#233;&#233;n met 48 duizend abonnees. AI Report begon in 2023 als podcast met Alexander Kl&#246;pping en Wietse Hage, maar is inmiddels uitgegroeid tot een heel imperium met lezingen en webinars. AI Report is niet alleen de Substack met de meeste abonnees, maar ook de nieuwsbrief met de meeste betaalde abonnees. Uiteraard helpt het voor de promotie dat Alexander Kl&#246;pping maandelijks aanschuift bij de populaire talkshow van Eva Jinek. Alexander Kl&#246;pping 's eigen Substack staat overigens op de tweede plek (38 duizend). Dit dubbele succes zie ik op meer plekken binnen Substack. Dat komt hoogstwaarschijnlijk doordat je bij het aanmelden ook suggesties krijgt voor andere Substacks. Samen met Ernst-Jan Pfauth staat Alexander Kl&#246;pping ook nog op de vijfde plek met de Podcast over Media (31 duizend abonnees). Ernst-Jan Pfauth staat zelf daarnaast ook nog op plek zeven en negen. Bij mijn research voor deze nieuwsbrief viel het mij trouwens op hoeveel succesvolle Nederlandstalige nieuwsbr",

On March 17, Popular Information exclusively published an internal Social Security Administration (SSA) memo that revealed plans to significantly limit phone service beginning April 1. The memo said the plan would flood already overburdened field offices with millions of additional people, creating \"service disruption,\" \"operational strain,\" and \"budget shortfalls.\" After the publication of Popular Information's report, major national news outlets, including Axios , The Washington Post , CNN , USA Today , and Newsweek , picked up the story. Popular Information was featured on The Rachel Maddow Show and Democracy Now! to discuss our report. Millions of people read the story online. Powerful advocacy groups, including the AARP , blasted the proposal. On April 9, the SSA announced it was scrapping their plans and would continue to \"allow all claim types to be completed over the telephone.\" Protecting the integrity of a key election in North Carolina. On April 15, Popular Information reported that at least 29 people had their ballots in the 2024 general election wrongly discarded by the North Carolina Supreme Court. The state's highest court ruled that about 260 ballots must be tossed because they were cast by people who were \"never residents\" of the state. The ballots - and thousands of others - were challenged by Jefferson Griffin, a Republican candidate for a seat on the North Carolina Supreme Court who lost by 734 votes to Democrat Allison Riggs. On April 16, the North Carolina Board of Elections filed a notice in federal court, citing Popular Information's reporting, stating that the votes of people who were wrongly identified would be restored . On May 5, the federal court took things one step further and ordered the North Carolina Board of Elections to certify Riggs as the winner. Griffin conceded two days later.

Read on for part 1 on the South Island. Opening thoughts The proverb \"May you live in interesting times\" looks like applying in spades both globally and in Aotearoa in 2026. The General Election due by October will either reinforce the status quo or offer the chance for a course correction. And the mechanics of MMP (Mixed Member Proportional) and the machinations of certain key players will likely be influential in the election outcome. Like 2025, there will be a range of public transport developments due to happen but only one, City Rail Link in T&#257;maki Makaurau, that is likely to get nationwide coverage. This first part of two will cover developments in Te Waipounamu/ South Island. The second part will cover Te Ika-&#257;-Maui/ North Island. Waihopai/ Invercargill Wednesday, 21st January will see the first scheduled passenger train arriving in Waihopai/ Invercargill since the demise of the Southerner in 2002. This will be a Mainlander train from &#332;tepoti/ Dunedin returning to Dunedin the following day. Notably, this train will not serve the former Invercargill Station in the city centre. Instead, passengers will be bused from the KiwiRail depot to the Distinction Hotel. At the time of writing, there was only one seat available on the trip from Invercargill to Dunedin. This trip doesn't come cheap with an adult fare of $129 to Dunedin and a through fare to Christchurch of $229 but requires an overnight stay in Dunedin. &#332;tepoti/ Dunedin Tuesday, 20th January will see the first Mainlander train from &#332;tautahi/ Christchurch to Dunedin with a stop in Te Tihi o Maru/ Timaru, returning to Christchurch on Thursday 23rd January.

The Our Better Angels service description on Facebook, Instagram and TST TV. Subscribe now Recently I found myself in a bit of an online dust up with erstwhile colleagues in The Satanic Temple and a howling mob of detractors over a Hellmouth Service I led on The Better Angels of Our Nature . To non-Temple Satanists this may seem like an odd topic to tackle but it has been listed as a Primary Text on TST's website for more than a decade. It matters to our religion. The controversy around the service was centered on Steven Pinker's resignation from the Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF) in support of Jerry Coyne, whose essay Biology is Not Bigotry was removed from the FFRF website due transphobia. Since that time, Pinker has been doing the rounds of \"respectable\" right-wing podcasts defending himself, Coyne, the rest of the Intellectual Dark Web and the Horsemen of Atheism who have all adopted much more right-wing, pro-Christian Hegemonic norm of \"Western Values\". And while Pinker has become quite an unsavory character (though those who have paid attention over the last 20+ years can point to other issues with him) his unsavoriness doesn't address the reasons why The Better Angels of Our Nature is part of The Satanic Temple's Primary Reading which was the point of the service. Despite the service clearly being framed around the issues in the book and its place in TST's belief structure a small but loud number of folks tried to invoke a heckler's veto so shu",

    "text": "Amazing Grace A Reason To Smile Credit: Getty Images It has been a harrowing week to close out an incomprehensible first year under the current president. This week, it is especially hard to find any reason to smile. So we have decided to pay homage to a song of healing and redemption: \"Amazing Grace.\" The iconic hymn, meant to inspire hope in the wake of tragedy, has become a \"spiritual national anthem,\" though its roots are English. The lyrics of \"Amazing Grace\" were penned by John Newton, a British poet, clergyman, and slave trader-turned-abolitionist, in 1772, though it wasn't immediately set to music. The poem made its way across the pond in the early 19th century, and then American composer William Walker set Newton's words to \"New Britain,\" a traditional melody. The song quickly became an integral part of the American tapestry, sung by Christian denominations in all corners of the young country. It was performed at tent revivals and became an anti-slavery ode. During the Civil War, the song was included in hymnals given to soldiers. The song has been professionally recorded more than 1,000 times by singers as diverse as Elvis Presley, Jessye Norman, Willie Nelson and Mahalia Jackson. Jackson's 1947 gospel version of \"Amazing Grace\" received significant radio airplay, popularizing the song around the country. Jackson helped elevate it to a powerful anthem for the Civil Rights Movement, singing the song at the March on Washington and other rallies led by Martin Luther King Jr. It also became an anti-war song. Folk singer Judy Collins recorded an a cappella version in 1970, which became a certified hit. \"I didn't know what else to do about the war in Vietnam. I had marched, I had voted, I had gone to jail on political actions and worked for the candidates I believed in. The war was still raging. There was nothing left to do, I thought ... but sing &#8216;Amazing Grace,'\" Collins said. The popularity of playing \"Amazing Grace\" on the bagpipes can be attributed to the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards ",

    "text": "The Late Arrival of 16-bit CP/M How CP/M 2.2’s Success Delayed the 8086 Port — and Whether It Really Mattered The story of how MS-DOS became the industry standard for the 16-bit business computers at the expense of Digital Research's CP/M is somewhat of a legend among fans of computing history. The event has been described in books, articles and documentaries, with most of them focusing on entertaining details such as corporate drama, back-stabbing and nepotism 1 . Some of the more serious accounts mention one important detail of the story: DRI was late with the port of the CP/M to the Intel 8086. When IBM representatives visited in August of 1980, looking for an operating system for their upcoming PC, only the 8-bit version of CP/M could be demonstrated. IBM eventually turned to Microsoft and selected what became MS&#8209;DOS. In this article, we will examine why CP/M&#8209;86 was delayed and, in the end, speculate how much that delay actually mattered. PL/I Development To understand why the CP/M port to the Intel 8086 was delayed, we need to go back to 1978. The current version of CP/M was 1.4, and it was already the industry standard as an operating system for 8-bit business microcomputers. At the time, Digital Research founder Dr. Gary Kildall felt that microcomputers needed a high-level application language - something better suited to application development than his PL/M, which was essentially a systems language 2 . At first, he considered Pascal. Then he received a call from Boston&#8209;based computer scientist Dr. Robert Freiburghouse, who invited him to join an ANSI standards committee working on the PL/I&#8209;G dialect. Kildall was familiar with PL/I and did not have a good opinion of it, but after attending several committee meetings he realized he liked the \"Subset G\" proposal and decided to implement a compiler. The plan was to complete the new compiler in nine months. Instead, development stretched to more than two years; the compiler was finally released in late 1980 under the name PL/I&#8209;80. DRI's PL/I received praises for its quality 3 - after all co",

This was pre-internet times, at least in the part of Yorkshire I grew up in, and since I had recently decided to try becoming a professional writer, my options seemed limited. My best bet? Submitting something to the BBC Radio 4 Afternoon Play - a daily slot with an absolutely ravenous appetite for new fiction, offering hundreds or sometimes even thousands (!!!) of pounds for a really good story - and when they accepted my manuscript and I was officially Discovered by all the big talent agencies, I could sit back and watch the money roll in. Did I actually have a really good story? Not in the least. That would have required effort, which I tended to avoid, and writing skill, which I wasn't yet aware I lacked. But hey, I had the next-best thing: I had a great character . Story is just character in action, right? Well then. Job mostly done! And wasn't my character completely brilliant ? Admittedly, it was heavily inspired by a few others. (\"Stolen\" might be a more legally-precise word.) I'd recently read W.E. Bowman's magnificent mountaineering satire The Ascent Of Rum Doodle , and become greatly enamoured of its hapless protagonist, Binder - and then I discovered Terry Pratchett's Corporal Carrot in all his heroic simplicity (which is not saying he's stupid, as I previously explained here ). My character - let's call him M. - was incapable of thinking the worst of strangers. This illustration of Hanlon's Razor would be utterly wasted on him, because it would never even occur to him that other people might act out of meanness, cruelty and petty spite. I mean, why would they? That would be awful !

If so, you might be curious about a new report from a group called Way to Win , which bills itself as \"a donor collaborative that invests in data-driven strategies to fund new media and grassroots efforts to win long-term political change.\" \" Towards Strength: Way to Win Post-2024 Research Summary \" contains some supposedly important news for Democrats and those who want them to win elections in the future: According to The New Republic (which got exclusive access to an early copy), the report reveals \"the Real Reason Democrats Lost in 2024.\" Let me go ahead and spoil that part immediately. Most of the report's arguments about why Harris lost consist of what is now the conventional wisdom: Kamala Harris didn't have a clear message, she didn't present herself as a \"change\" candidate during a \"change\" election, and so on. (As the authors note, she couldn't name a single thing she'd have done differently from Joe Biden , the flailing and unpopular incumbent to whom she was tethered.) All true, but all well-trod terrain. Even the document's working definition of \"strength,\" a word that appears in its very title, doesn't really say much that's new: \"What exactly is strength? As the Supreme Court's famous approach would suggest: &#8216;you know it when you see it.' But as a working definition: political strength is making decisions based on core values and principles, explaining choices with clear and persuasive arguments, drawing a contrast with one's opponents, and making it clear why your approach is the better one.\" What are those core values and principles?

Titled Army Talks, the series was designed \"to help [the personnel] become better-informed men and women and therefore better soldiers.\" On March 24, 1945, the topic for the week was \"FASCISM!\" \"You are away from home, separated from your families, no longer at a civilian job or at school and many of you are risking your very lives,\" the pamphlet explained, \"because of a thing called fascism.\" But, the publication asked, what is fascism? \"Fascism is not the easiest thing to identify and analyze,\" it said, \"nor, once in power, is it easy to destroy. It is important for our future and that of the world that as many of us as possible understand the causes and practices of fascism, in order to combat it.\" Fascism, the U.S. government document explained, \"is government by the few and for the few. The objective is seizure and control of the economic, political, social, and cultural life of the state.\" \"The people run democratic governments, but fascist governments run the people.\" \"The basic principles of democracy stand in the way of their desires; hence-democracy must go! Anyone who is not a member of their inner gang has to do what he's told. They permit no civil liberties, no equality before the law.\" \"Fascism treats women as mere breeders. &#8216;Children, kitchen, and the church,' was the Nazi slogan for women,\" the pamphlet said. Fascists \"make their own rules and change them when they choose&#8230;. They maintain themselves in power by use of force combined with propaganda based on primitive ideas of &#8216;blood' and &#8216;race,' by skillful manipulation of fear and hate, and by false promise of security. The propaganda glorifies war and insists it is smart and &#8216;realistic' to be pitiless and violent.\" Fascists understood that \"the fundamental principle of democracy-faith in the common sense of the common people-was the dire",

    "text": "The actual barrier to self-driving cars Plus necktie advice, M.T.A. elevator spending, and the truth about my group chat with Marc Andreessen Waymo plans to put more self-driving cars on the road in 2026. (Photo by Jason Doiy ) Kate told me that I couldn't get a whole column out of this, but before we get to today's questions I want to address the young men of America on the subject of buttoning your top button and wearing a necktie : If this is uncomfortable, that's because your shirt doesn't fit. It is annoying that simple S/M/L/XL sizing makes it kind of a crapshoot as to whether any given dress shirt will have appropriate length sleeves for your arms and fit your midsection and also your neck. But if you go to Brooks Brothers or Charles Tyrwhitt (just to name two stores that exist in most cities), they size their shirts with separate neck and arm lengths, and you can get one that fits. Or you can go to Proper Cloth or another \"made to measure\" place where they'll sell you a shirt that fits exactly. Unfortunately, all of these options are a little more expensive than what you'll pay for a shirt that doesn't fit. But you either don't need to wear a tie very often, in which case getting one shirt that fits is not a major investment, or else you do need to wear a tie frequently, in which case you shouldn't be uncomfortable all the time. Thank you for your attention to this matter. lindamc: I read and listen to a lot of SB-adjacent stuff and I noticed that, at the end of 2025, quite a few take slingers (for example, those on Josh Barro's new podcast and a couple of UK/European substackers) expressed optimism for the next year. This made me feel good! Then I read your intro to last Friday's mailbag. As a very logical person, how do you think of optimism? Is it an irrational way to view the world, even when things seem to be going pretty badly? Can/should its adaptive function outweigh this kind of downside? Do *you* feel at all optimistic about 2026 (in a general, not strictly electoral, sense)? Here's last Friday's mailbag , for reference. I don't think of myself as a pessimistic person or a doomer.

There's greed&#8230; and then there's the nauseating greed of profiteering corporations that make a killing &#8211; literally &#8211; by knowingly contaminating people's water, air, land, and families. Such rank, moral corruption is hard to fathom... but it's not hard to find. For one breathtaking example, consider Freeport-McMoRan . Support indie journalism: upgrade today This global mining behemoth is one of America's most aggressive spoliers of land, air, water, and health &#8211; including from its sprawling copper smelter near Phoenix, Arizona. This operation is a major spreader of lead pollution, a neurotoxin that's particularly harmful to children, causing pain, seizures, and learning disabilities. But wait, where's our Environmental Protection Agency ? Good question. In fact, until last year, EPA was requiring Freeport to install technology to cut those poisonous emissions. The giant squealed like a stuck pig, though, crying that the $60 million cost for the lifesaving equipment was too \"burdensome \" &#8211; even though that wouldn't even be a drop in Freeport's $2-billion-a-year bucket of profits. Sure enough, in October, Trump's new EPA honcho rushed to provide pollution protection. Not for the children, but for the polluter! Indeed, Trump's corporate-coddling agency \"super-streamlined\" the regulatory process by essentially eliminating it &#8211; no public hearing required, no presentation of facts, to chance for victims to object. All Freeport had to do was send an email requesting regulatory relief, and &#8211; BAM! &#8211; Trump promptly exempted its Arizona smelter from having to clean up its act. Not only is this \"free pass to pollute\" a blunt proclamation of corporate rule, it also expresses Trump's deep contempt for working-class people. Imagine if that smelter was in Florida, poisoning the elites in his Mar-a-Lago resort. Then, he'd jump on it like a gator on a poodle. Do something!

Thank you! &#129505; With gratitude to this community, we raised $17,000 toward our $30,000 fundraising goal , strengthening our ability to carry this work into the first half of 2026. We're deeply grateful for your support! What exactly are ethics, and how important are they in human medical research? Ethics are a set of principles that help us figure out what's right and wrong. In medical research, they help to keep the people taking part safe, make sure the research does more good than harm, and ensure the results can be trusted. Note: This post was updated by Those Nerdy Girls from the original published on May 23, 2025. Bottom line up front - Medical research is strictly regulated, and ethical principles or rules play a key role in keeping people safe and the scientific process rigorous. These \"moral values\" are among many checks and balances in place to make sure this happens. That said, like the rest of science, this is an ongoing and interactive process, and there is always room for improvement. But what does it MEAN? In essence, ethics refers to the principles of right and wrong that guide behavior, and it includes the study of moral obligations and values. And how is this important in human medical research? In human medical research, ethics plays an important role to ensure that studies are carried out in a way that people taking part are protected and that some important principles are upheld. These principles make sure that researchers maintain scientific integrity through clearly-defined standards, like obtaining informed consent, minimizing risks, and treating those taking part in the research with respect and fairness. Research projects have to go through a thorough review to get \"ethics approval\" from a Research Ethics Committee before they can even begin. This is a detailed process for scientists, and there are many checks and balances in place before a university's Research Ethics Committee or an Institutional Review Board (called \"IRB\") accepts a",

Last year (2025) might have seen the lowest number of existing home sales since 1995. It will be close! Even if sales beat 2024 sales, these will be the two lowest sales years since 1995. Sales will be worse than any year during the housing bust. Most readers probably don't remember 1995, but I do! If I went to an open house &#8216;95, I was frequently the only person to visit all day. Just me and the crickets. December sales will be mostly for contracts signed in October and November, and mortgage rates averaged 6.25% in October and 6.24% in November (lower than for closed sales in November). Closed Sales in December In December, sales in these early reporting markets were up 2.5% YoY. Last month, i n November, these same markets were down 10.8% year-over-year Not Seasonally Adjusted (NSA). Important : There was one more working days in December 2025 (22) as in December 2024 (21). So, the year-over-year change in the headline SA data will be less than the change in NSA data (there are other seasonal factors). Notes for all tables: New additions to table in BOLD . For the previous month, there were one fewer working days in November 2025 (18) as in November 2024 (19). So, the year-over-year change in the headline SA data was more than the change in NSA data (there are other seasonal factors). Sales in all of these markets are down sharply compared to December 2019. This graph shows existing home sales by month for 2024 and 2025, on a Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate (SAAR) basis. Last year, the NAR reported sales in December 2024 were at 4.29 million SAAR. This early data suggests that December existing sales (as reported seasonally adjusted by the NAR) might be up slightly year-over-year. New Listings in December For these areas, new listings were down 9.6% year-over-year. NOTE: The San Diego new listing data is likely incorrect. Last month, new listings in these markets were down 3.5% year-over-year. New listings are still down 28% compared to December 2019 activit",

    "text": "An Epic win jolts Google The company's app store monopoly has been ruled illegal, and the ramifications will extend well beyond Fortnite \"a comical scene with a large, colorful Google logo being chased by characters in a Fortnite-style environment\" / DALL-E Today let's talk about a high-stakes ruling against Google in a closely watched antitrust case, and consider what it might mean both for the companies involved and the larger digital economy. Late Monday, the jury deliberating in Epic Games' lawsuit against Google ruled in favor of the Fortnite developer. It found that Google harmed Epic by creating a monopoly in in-app billing and app distribution within the Android ecosystem, illegally tying the app store and its billing system together. A series of revenue-sharing deals with developers and device manufacturers were also found to harm competition. Epic's lawsuit was filed in 2020. Around the same time, the company sued Apple on similar grounds, claiming Apple's app store monopoly and ban on third-party billing systems was anticompetitive and illegal. But Epic ( mostly ) lost that case, which was decided by a judge. As this new trial unfolded, Sean Hollister wrote at The Verge , \" Epic v. Google turned out to be a very different case .\" He continues: It hinged on secret revenue sharing deals between Google, smartphone makers, and big game developers, ones that Google execs internally believed were designed to keep rival app stores down . It showed that Google was running scared of Epic specifically. And it was all decided by a jury, unlike the Apple ruling. Last week Hollister wrote a recap of the trial that, in addition to exploring the many facets of each company's arguments, serves as a highly entertaining account of Google's app-store related chicanery over the years: sweetheart deals to favored developers like Spotify and Netflix ; successful efforts to prevent third-party app stores from launching ; and the lies it told about its app store not being designed as a profit center. (The Play Store's profit margin in 2021 was estimated during the trial to be 71 percent.) And Epic managed to prov",

Thanks to everyone who subscribes, and especially paid subscribers, which are never expected but always welcome. Reminder: this December, I will match any new paid subscriptions to Can We Still Govern? with an equivalent gift to Give Directly , so consider subscribing! Subscribe now In this piece (lets call it Volume I), I'm sharing the five most-read pieces from last year in reverse order. A central theme of this year's most popular articles was the assault on state capacity that came with Trump's return to office. The fifth-most read piece came from an NIH insider who explained how budget rules were being weaponized to undermine the agency. It is a reminder about how the administrative details really matter. The fourth most-read piece combined a commentary that Pam Herd and I wrote in Science about the politicization of scientific agencies, as well as a call for people to make a public comment about the politicization of the government more generally. More than 40,000 submitted comments, overwhelmingly opposed to the change. People are looking for meaningful ways to register that they do not like what is happening to their government. Share Back in March I wrote about the encroaching sense of threat against speech disfavored by the President: \"The right to say what we want, to choose our topics of study, is essentially American. But we don't live in America any longer. The truth is, we live in a foreign country now.\" Things have only gotten worse since then. People really hate Elon Musk. And so people were pretty excited when he overestimated his political skills to pour millions into a Wisconsin election, including a potentially illegal lottery scheme to incentivize voters, only to lose very badly. The election, which took place at the start of April, was an early and important benchmark that Musk, DOGE, and the Trump administration more broadly had reached the end of wh",

    "text": "2026 Resolution: Lower Grocery Prices How states can address our food affordability crisis Welcome to You're Probably Getting Screwed, a weekly newsletter and video series from J.D. Scholten and Justin Stofferahn about the Second Gilded Age and the ways economic concentration is putting politics and profits over working people. Welcome to 2026! For the last two years I have tried to open the year discussing the important role states can play in helping address our monopoly crisis. This is in part because with the start of the new year also comes the start of legislative sessions across the country. Today I will be doing the same thing, but with a specific focus on how legislators can tackle high grocery prices which have risen nearly 30% since the start of 2020. These high costs figure to be a major concern for voters in 2026, as the issue has for several years now. However, while it might be convenient to simply blame high costs on tariffs and trade wars, there is a much more systemic problem lurking at the grocery store and legislators need to address it head on. Today I will explore some of the unfair pricing tactics driving up costs and the tools legislators can give state enforcers to bring down costs and protect small businesses. For all you Iowans, the Telegraph Herald has an in-depth piece that found Dubuque had 104 grocery stores in 1952 and today there are just 12 (mostly Walmart & Hy-Vee) with unfair pricing tactics a key culprit in that shift. States can put an end to this! I should mention that if you want a broader look at the corporate power issues confronting state policymakers across the country, you absolutely need to check out Pat Garofalo's annual State Legislative Policy Preview in his newsletter Boondoggle. Court documents released to the public last month demonstrate how unfair practices not only harm small businesses, but also raise costs for everyone. Last year the Federal Trade Commission under former chair Lina Khan filed a lawsuit against Pepsi in the final days of the Biden Administration. The complaint alleged Pepsi had viola",

    "text": "Why Europe should resist the Second China Shock Deindustrialization sounds peaceful and easy and pleasant, but it's not. Photo by Alexander-93 via Wikimedia Commons Europe has a lot on its plate these days . It's facing a hostile Russia that has no intention of stopping with Ukraine. It's dealing with tariffs and various other threats from an unpredictable and hostile Trump administration. And it's struggling with internal unrest over migration from the Middle East and Central Asia. That would be enough to keep anyone occupied. But on top of all that, Europe is being buffeted by the Second China Shock. The Second China Shock is another name for the flood of high-tech exports that China has been sending out around the world in the last few years. China's economy is still suffering from the prolonged effects of the real estate bust that began in late 2021. In response, Xi Jinping's government has unleashed the most expensive and wide-ranging industrial policy the world has ever seen, promoting high-tech manufacturing across a variety of sectors. Because the economy is in the doldrums, Chinese consumers themselves aren't able to buy all the stuff that their government is paying Chinese companies to make - electric vehicles, ships, machinery, and so on. So the companies are selling that stuff overseas, anywhere they can, for cut-rate prices. In Europe, that has manifested as a giant trade deficit with China: Source: Bloomberg This flood of Chinese exports to Europe is being boosted by several tailwinds. First, China's currency has gotten cheaper - partly as a result of China's weak domestic economy, and partly because the government has pushed down the exchange rate in order to pump up exports. Shanghai Macro Strategist writes : This combination - falling relative prices in China and a weaker currency - has made Chinese goods and services extraordinarily cheap in global terms&#8230;A vivid example: a night at the Four Seasons Beijing costs roughly $250, compared with more than $1,160 in New York.

(Photo via TrumpBelgrade.com) This week, Jared Kushner abruptly canceled his plans to build Trump Tower Belgrade after the project became enmeshed in a criminal corruption scandal involving Serbian government officials. Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law, has resumed his role as one of Trump's top foreign policy advisers - representing the Trump administration in high-stakes negotiations over Gaza and Ukraine. But Kushner has also continued to run his private equity firm, Affinity Partners. In 2024, armed with billions of dollars from Saudi Arabia and other foreign governments, Kushner inked a deal with the Serbian government to redevelop the former headquarters of the Yugoslav Army in Belgrade into a luxury hotel and residences. The building was damaged by NATO in 1999 during an aerial bombing campaign. The deal included extremely favorable terms for Kushner. The Serbian government agreed to grant Affinity Partners a 99-year lease to the property , which is a prime location in central Belgrade, for free . Kushner also had the option to convert the lease to full ownership at no cost. Affinity Partners would then keep 78% of the profits from the $500 million development, with the Serbian government entitled to 22%. In January 2025, shortly before Trump's second inauguration, Kushner reached a deal with the Trump Organization to brand the development as a Trump Tower. That agreement meant Trump would directly profit from the successful development of the site. There was one big problem: the property was designated a culturally protected site by Serbian law. It could not be developed unless the Serbian government changed its status. The deal struck between the administration of Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and Kushner required the Serbian government \"to remove the cultural designation of the complex and to complete demolition work of the existing buildings\" by May 2026. Failure to do so would entitle Affinity Partners to millions in penalty payments from the S",

Neon Sir&#226;t starts by defining its title: \"The Sir&#226;t bridge connects paradise and hell. Whoever ventures across must know its path is narrower than a strand of hair and sharper than a sword.\" This explanation seems to be the prism through which we're meant to interpret the entire story, and that's part of the problem. It establishes this mad world as existing on the precipice between eternal joy and suffering, but the film's heavy emphasis on the suffering feels less existential and more nihilistic. Director/co-writer &#211;liver Laxe generates tension, shock, and heartbreak, but I couldn't escape the question, what is this all for? [ SPOILERS FOLLOW ] Subscribe now The film sets up an arduous journey upfront. Luis ( Sergi L&#243;pez ) is searching for his missing daughter Mar with the help of his son Esteban ( Bruno Nu&#241;ez Arjona ). They haven't heard from her in five months, but think she might be attending a rave in southern Morocco. There they meet partygoers Steff ( Stefania Gadda ), Josh ( Joshua Liam Henderson ), Bigui ( Richard Bellamy ), Tonin ( Tonin Janvier ), and Jade ( Jade Oukid ), who inform them of another rave soon thereafter where they might find who they're looking for.

That's it, that's what ensues. Neon I don't believe I can properly discuss Sir&#226;t without going into specifics, but the film itself leaves some details to the imagination. For instance, we never learn what caused the estrangement between Luis and his daughter, if anything. Esteban explains to Bigui at one point, \"She didn't run off. Mar is a grown-up, she just left.\" So we don't know why they're afraid for her or what intel led them to Morocco. We don't get a lot of background on the ravers either.

Today, the Russian special services maintain this tradition. Pravfond , a state-backed Russian foundation that provides legal aid to Russian citizens abroad, is in fact a support network for spies, criminals and propagandists, as an investigation last year by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project discovered. Rossotrudnichestvo , the Russian Foreign Ministry's \"cultural\" arm, is a clearinghouse for the SVR, Russia's foreign intelligence service. And the GRU, Russia's military intelligence service, leverages the Institute of Russian Diaspora, among other groups, for the prosecution of psychological warfare against the West. The introduction for the English translation of this KGB training manual was written by Dr. Kevin Riehle , a friend and colleague of Foreign Office. Kevin is a lecturer at Brunel University London, and a 30-year veteran counterintelligence analyst in the U.S. government. He is the author of several magisterial books on the Soviet and Russian intelligence services, including a history of the FSB . - Michael Weiss The KGB believed that no anti-Soviet &#233;migr&#233; group could exist without the assistance of a foreign intelligence service. It taught its officers that anti-Soviet national movements abroad were, by definition, nothing but tools that foreign intelligence services used to conduct ideological sabotage against the Soviet Union. It is true that US and British intelligence services tried to employ some anti-Soviet &#233;migr&#233; groups against the Soviet Union. They recruited members of the groups and tried to direct their anti-Soviet fervor in a desired direction. However, that effort waned by the late 1950s.

An image published by U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton and Assistant U.S. Attorney Varun A. Gumaste in a January 5, 2026 letter filed on Tuesday, apparently showing a WhatsApp conversation between the former CIA operative Robert M. Sensi and a controlled DEA asset posing as a member of Mexico's Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG). \"Are we going to curacao this week? Bill, you and me?\" asked a controlled U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) asset in a message to former CIA operative Robert M. Sensi at 9:35 p.m. on July 20, as part of a sting targeting both Sensi and his close business partner, former deputy DEA financial operations chief Paul Campo. The small Dutch island of Cura&#231;ao, a money-laundering haven off the northern coasts of Venezuela and Colombia, would have been a fitting place for a meeting between Sensi and the DEA asset (\"Confidential Source-1\" / \"CS-1\"), who was posing as a member of Mexico's Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG). According to the U.S. Government's indictment against Sensi and Campo following their December 4 arrest, the pair \"agreed to launder approximately $12,000,000 of narcotics proceeds for the CJNG; laundered approximately $750,000 by converting cash into cryptocurrency; and provided payment for approximately 220 kilograms of cocaine.\" The indictment further alleged that the confidential source stated, \"Welcome to the fucking cartel\" after the completion of an initial June 3, 2025 transfer of $200,000 to the pair in Charlotte, North Carolina. The newly named partner for the would-be meeting between Sensi and the DEA asset in Cura&#231;ao, \"Bill,\" was implied to be a representative of an unnamed Colombian organization designated by the U.S. Government as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.

In a vacuum, the latest Apple executive departures were of little note. Apple user interface design leader Alan Dye and a deputy decamped for Meta this week, and longtime Apple watchers greeted the moves warmly. Dye, the guy behind Apple's controversial &#8216;Liquid Glass' operating system, was reportedly better at corporate politics than design, and his departure is set to make room for fresh sensibilities within the tech giant. But zoom out a bit, and Dye's move to Meta might well be the start of the great AI device wars, which appear ready to explode. Meta is going to put Dye on its AI wearables projects, bringing his Apple know-how to the Ray-Ban Meta and Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, the latter of which contains a screen in its lens. With Amazon, Google, and OpenAI also working on their own AI hardware, the race to create the device of the future is getting underway with urgency. \"We're at a historic inflection point where the AI devices we're building are poised to fundamentally reshape the way we interact with technology,\" Meta chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth said in a post announcing Dye's hiring. \"Excited to see what this team can do.\" For Meta and Apple, the fight is personal. Meta's leadership has long hated working through operating systems like Apple's iOS to reach their users. And Apple has used its power to cause the company serious problems, breaking Meta's ad targeting and even shutting down its internal apps at one point. Meta's been so determined to get ahead of the next computing shift that it bet massively ( and wrongly ) on virtual reality and the Metaverse. But AI-powered wearables are showing more promise, with sales of smartglasses tripling this year , and Meta is out ahead. Subscribe now Apple understands the stakes. While an AI device likely won't replace the iPhone, the category could be an area of significant growth over time. So Apple has been working on a smartglasses product of its own - once again following Meta, as it did ",

Photo: Ikin Yum In conversation with Flo O'Mahony, edited by Laurie Ogden Putting Perfect Show for Rachel on stage has always felt like a rebellious and radical act. My big sister Rachel, who is learning disabled and lives in a care home, directs the show live from her tech desk with 50+ buttons that different trigger scenes, songs, dances, chats and games. All of these are things that Rachel loves &#8211; from Kylie Minogue to massive fights to waving at boys &#8211; and she gets to decide and control the order they happen in, in each and every performance. The show explores who defines artistic taste, who is currently excluded from making art, and who gets to decide what art is \"perfect\". A huge team was involved in creating this show alongside Rachel &#8211; me, wearing the dual hats of sister and artistic director of Zoo Co; Lee Simpson (co-AD of Improbable); a vast assembly of people in creative and production roles, and a cast of 12 on stage, including our mum, Wendy (75 per cent of my nuclear family is on stage!).

So in returning to the show this year for a new tour, we are once again encouraging ourselves to both stay true to Rachel's vision, and to challenge our assumptions around what her tastes might be and how they may have changed over the years of performing this show. What does this mean for revisiting a show we have already deemed &#8216;perfect'? One of the biggest challenges of making this show, even from the get-go, was discovering Rachel's taste and interrogating where it comes from. Rachel's life has previously been one where choices are presented to her in very limiting ways, partly because of how her brain works and her access needs, but partly because our society is set up in a",

And it was a subsequent disappointment to discover that, rather than offering some foolproof three step guide to anal gaping, these resources all pretty much offered up the same advice: you just have to train yourself to relax the sphincter! It is, I think, the paradox of so many extreme sex acts that what appears, superficially, to be an act of extreme toughness, of physical prowess and force, is actually, to the contrary, an experience of extreme softness, of letting yourself go. Yes, you can grit your teeth and endure a flogging session, or piercing play, but that's not really the point, is it? The point is to let oneself go, to let these sensations bring you a release akin to the feeling of a tight adhesion that melts away into relaxed muscle in response to the firm pressure of a massage therapist's hands.

No matter the topic, no matter how much research you do or how educated you are, someone will always take issue with what you write. I know I have taken issue with some non-fiction and will continue to do so. The reasons are many, but most of them come down to personal viewpoints. I've been on the end of cancelling and censorship. Oddly enough, I have Stan Lee and Jack Kirby to blame for that. My view has always been this: I believe that Stan Lee and Jack Kirby both had hands in the creation of the modern Marvel Universe. I believe that Stan wrote comic books and co-created some characters with Jack - that they worked together. Simple? If only. For a certain cohort, it's never been that simple, nor will it ever be. They will scream at you until they are red in the face that Stan did nothing. They will tell you, as a fact (even though they were not there and not even alive when it happened), that Jack wrote, drew and did the lot, on his own, even on comic books that he never had a hand in. They will tell you that Jack Kirby was the driving force behind Marvel, and still is, decades after his passing. They call themselves Kirby Kultists. Good for them. They have, over the years, attempted to undermine me, abused me, threatened me and approached others, including my family and close friends, to attempt to cancel me out. Sometimes they've succeeded in having me removed from groups, more often than not, they've failed. And, if you think I'm joking, just go to Google and type, \"Who created the Marvel Universe\" or \"Did Stan Lee or Jack Kirby Create the Marvel Universe\" and doom scroll your little fingers until they fall off. It's a rabbit hole of epic proportions. And to some people, this is their life. It's what they live for. You may laugh, but it's very, very real.

These men belong to a sect that believes that it's a mitzvah, a good deed, to get less observant Jews to put on tefillin, which are black leather boxes containing parchment inscribed with verses from the Torah. You wear one on your arm and one on your head - I think the last time I did this was during my bar mitzvah. They'll go up to possibly Jewish men and ask, \"Are you Jewish?\" &#9;Because I have a large, crooked nose, whenever I run in the park, these Jews home in on me like ducks chasing an anthropomorphic sack of bread crumbs. This triggers insecurities I thought I had conquered long ago. I'm otherwise over my nose. It was women I'd always been most concerned about, but over time I realized that some women - perverts - are into noses like mine, and others are willing to overlook it because I have developed so many other positive qualities, though I am precluded by space constraints from listing any of them here.

He was six-foot-eight, easily, a buck fifty soaking wet. I immediately found myself relating to him, simply because of my own feelings about my own dumb body.

The core argument: men are suffering, society tells them to shut up, women have impossible standards, and the only people who truly validate men's pain are the \"toxic masculinity\" influencers everyone keeps criticising and ultimately, if we stopped judging these men, they wouldn't need Tate.

Dr K claims that when men say they're suffering, the response is \"shut up.\" But here's what the manosphere consistently omits: the silencing isn't coming from women; it's coming from other men. The real barrier isn't that men are forbidden from speaking about their pain. It's their unwillingness to self-reflect beyond their anger, their unnecessarily limited vocabulary to describe their inner experience, and perhaps most profoundly, the overt and caustic pressure placed on them at the slightest hint of that inner pain, not by women, but by men, and often those closest to them. The men these podcasts appeal to seem unwilling to acknowledge their complicity in their own suffering.

Animal brains compute DNA-encoded behavioral strategies, using DNA chosen by simple natural selection. Such brains can \"reason\", but not very abstractly, and mostly about how to execute their DNA-given instincts. Animals don't reason about where such strategies came from. In humans, DNA encodes sufficiently-sophisticated brains to let us copy others' behaviors. As a result, in humans a cultural form of natural selection allows us to evolve behaviors far faster than do other animals. This is humanity's superpower. It induces us to reason more, about how best to generalize from the behaviors we see, and also about which humans to copy which behaviors from. The invention of language let humans more easily transfer many things between our brains, to do so more abstractly, and to reason more easily about it all. We humans thus became more ambitious about the scope and abstraction of our reasoning. We humans eventually came to realize that we could try to reason critically about the behaviors which we have inherited via cultural evolution. But as natural selection didn't document its code, we mostly made up plausible-sounding reasons for such behaviors. While some of us were sometimes willing to change behavior based on such reasoning, this typically went badly, as we didn't understand why evolution had made its choices. Thankfully, most others didn't much respect or heed such reasoning.

Morgan was optimistic that computers would soon be able to read human text instead of punch cards. \"Many humanities scholars are eagerly awaiting the day when they can get their computers to scan a book,\" he wrote in a new journal called Computers and the Humanities . Hopefully, he said, it would be as simple as shovelling the text \"into the maw of the machine\", leaving the computer to sort out the technical bits. Morgan was an archaeologist and a computer scientist; as early as 1966, he dreamed of getting computers to read and analyze ancient Minoan hieroglyphs. [1] Morgan was working at the height of the so-called Golden Age of AI when many problems, like computer vision, appeared to have simple solutions. After all, he had just seen the IBM 1287 firsthand and it could read 10 digits and five letters of the alphabet, provided they were written in special boxes on cards. This was proof of concept. \"It can read any printed, typewritten or handwritten numbers,\" h e explained, excitedly , \"and it is at this point that we have a glimpse of what humanists are waiting for, an optical reader which will read any font&#8230;A machine that combines cheapness\" with accuracy. If this transpired, Morgan could see that a whole host of knowledge-work professions would be radically changed. He was a bit early. Sixty years after the launch of the IBM 1287, Gemini 3 Pro has solved handwriting transcription, scoring at levels previously reserved for expert human typists. In our tests, it did so reliably and without hallucinations. As we'll see, the errors it does make are different than those that humans make and are largely centred on fixing punctuation, capitalization, and spelling errors in the original. That this level of accuracy was achieved by a generalist tool like an LLM rather than specialized systems will appear remarkable and surprising to many, but was entirely predictable.

We need more infrastructure - including fossil fuel infrastructure - to ensure that electricity is affordable. Dear readers, One issue that has helped Democrats in this year's elections is public dissatisfaction with electricity prices. Electricity prices in September were 5.1% higher than one year earlier, and the upward march of electricity costs under Donald Trump extends an ongoing trend from the Biden administration. Consumer electricity prices rose by 37.5% from January 2020 to September of this year, outpacing general CPI inflation, which totaled 25.2% over the same period. The cost of piped natural gas has risen even more sharply over that time - 49.3%. Since the start of 2020, consumer prices for electricity and natural gas have significantly outpaced general inflation, while gasoline prices have been volatile and have recently lagged general inflation. (Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics via FRED) When you're out of power, inflation is a good issue for you, and Democrats have capitalized on President Trump's failure to actually make life more affordable. But over the long run, Republicans have an advantage on energy as a political issue, because they actually implement policies that make energy cheaper. States run by Republicans tend to have much cheaper electricity than those run by Democrats: while consumers paid a national average of $0.18 per kilowatt hour for electricity in September, the average rate was $0.30 in New England, $0.24 in the Mid-Atlantic, and $0.32 in California . As a party, we should be nervous about the increasing salience of this issue, because we are worse than Republicans at delivering the cheap electricity that consumers want. To gain a long-run advantage on the energy issue, Democrats need to commit to providing energy that is cheap and abundant. That's going to require changing the way we govern, making it easier to produce energy and deliver it to consumers. And it's going to mean scaling back policies that intentionally raise the cost of energy in pursuit of carbon emissions reduction. Consider the situation in Connecticut, which",

I was seventeen, newly arrived in New York City, and obsessed with Tristan Taormino, then the writer of a weekly Village Voice sex column, Pucker Up. Tristan was many things, but she was especially an anal sex expert, with a specific focus on helping other women find pleasure in their assholes ( she literally wrote the book on it ). My teenage crush on Tristan made me want to experience anal pleasure myself: when she released her very own butt plug, I bought it*, and used it to explore my own asshole, and develop a rudimentary understanding of my own anal pleasure response. So it is interesting, given those queer beginnings, how much of my imagination around anal sex revolves around men, and specifically cis men. To be fair, it's not just me: think about the last time you saw anal sex referenced in pop culture. I'm willing to bet there was a man, or the implication of a man, involved somehow. For starters, the most common way that we even discuss anal sex in the first place is through the lens of gay** male experience. \"Fudgepacker\" has a very specific connotation, and it's not about the joys of hetero assfucks. The purest distillation of anal pleasure is presumed to be one man sticking his dick in another man's ass, a penis meeting a prostate in an experience of mutual pleasure. Even when women enter the picture, anal is still presumed to revolve around men. A number of people can't wrap their heads around the idea that women - and especially cis women - might find anal stimulation erotic in and of itself; the anus is presumed too dirty, too taboo, to spark the feminine libido. Feminine anal pleasure is assumed to be about pleasing men : either through offering up our poor, prostateless assholes*** to amuse and arouse someone else's penis, or by going to town on someone else's prostate with a finger or toy or, if we're feeling brave, even a strap-on.

Under new work requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly called Food Stamps), the main US program that helps low-income families afford food, a slow month with this erratic scheduling could strip him and his family of vital assistance. That's despite this dad averaging 32 hours of work per week-well above the 80-hour monthly minimum the law will soon require. Subscribe now Proponents of this new policy&#8211;a part of July's One Big Beautiful Bill Act that is scheduled to take effect in March 2026&#8211;say that this policy will encourage parents to do more to provide for their kids. But the dad working at the pizzeria is not lazy or unwilling to work. In fact, he is doing everything he can to work more hours, taking on extra last-minute shifts when offered. But sometimes his shifts are cancelled or he is sent home early when business is slow. He is one of the parents in a study we have been conducting with over 1,000 service-worker parents, as part of our decade-long research collaboration on the realities of low-wage work and parenting in the 21 st -century United States. His story reveals that today's low-wage work environment is defined by extreme volatility that workers cannot control. The low-wage labor market has fundamentally changed. With the decline of middle-skill jobs and the economic shift away from manufacturing, workers with low levels of formal education- especially parents-are now concentrated in the service sector. Service sector jobs are volatile, with work schedules, like this dad's, fluctuating in response to factors such as foot traffic, weather, local sporting events, and corporate profit targets. These unstable schedules are already hard on parents, worsening mental health and sleep quality . And the new SNAP requirements will am",

Such anti-social behaviour may be masked by smarmy, superficial charm. Psychopathy is pernicious because, despite relative rarity (~1% of the general population), the trait has left a dark, enduring and still-spreading stain on the tapestry of human affairs.

And yet in spite of how proud I was of the work I was doing, I knew, even at the time, that it was incomplete, even from a health and safety perspective. To be blunt: there was no way that I could educate my students about how to safely engage in anal pleasure - an omission which, let's be real, put certain groups of students at a bigger disadvantage than others. Oh, sure, I could tell them how to use a condom or a dental dam to protect themselves, and that knowledge would suffice regardless of what orifice was in play during their, ahem, play. I could maybe even explain that if you wanted to use a \"female\" condom internally for anal sex, that you would need to remove the inner ring before inserting it. But anyone who thinks that safe and healthy anal sex* begins and ends with barrier protection is kidding themselves.

The act of violence by a federal officer that killed an unarmed American is an unimaginable horror and a national atrocity. Renee Good was murdered by an ICE agent on her way home from dropping off her first grader at school. Video from three different angles shows Good driving onto a street full of protesters and agents near her Minneapolis home. One can then see Good maneuvering her car at the command of several agents. According to eyewitnesses, two agents were yelling at her simultaneously and at cross purposes to turn around, back up, stop, and get out of the car. She rolled down her window to hear and speak with them. Moments before the shooting, she was inching her car forward. An agent, who was standing on the left side of the car, raised his gun and shot Good at point-blank range. A doctor in the crowd offered to help Good. The agent would not let him, saying, \"I don't care.\" Good was a poet and stay-at-home mom who was born and raised in Colorado. She has been described as a devoted Christian who was not politically active, according to her ex-husband's father. Her social media accounts appear to bear this out. Once again, the president and his lackeys are asking Americans not to believe what they see with their own eyes. Rather than console the family or condemn the violence, he orchestrated a fiction to cover up ICE's criminality, abuse of power, and the failures of his draconian deportation policies. Trump claims the ICE agent acted in self-defense and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem called Good a domestic terrorist who weaponized her car to target the agents. While die-hard Trumpsters might gobble that up like it's Thanksgiving dinner, the real story can be seen on the video taken by multiple bystanders.

Image source: Getty images If a nation's diet requires ecological destruction to sustain it, can it really be called healthy? There was a time when Robert F. Kennedy Jr. would have said no. Before he became the nation's top health official, Kennedy built his career arguing that human health and environmental health were inseparable-that pollution in rivers became pollution in bodies, and that climate change itself was a public health emergency driven by industrial systems. His premise was simple: when the ecosystems that sustain life become unstable, human health becomes unstable too. But in office, Kennedy has begun governing as if health begins and ends inside the human body. Nowhere is that clearer than in the new federal food pyramid his department unveiled this week-an inverted version of the original triangle that encourages beef and dairy consumption on nutritional grounds while ignoring the deeply harmful environmental systems required to produce those foods on an industrial scale. You don't ever need to pay for HEATED-it's free. But if you have the means, paid subscriptions keep us alive and independent. The new inverted food pyramid isn't merely a poster meant to guide individual choices. It is a set of policy guidelines that directs billions of public dollars toward specific foods, and the agricultural system that supplies them. It determines what food gets bought for school meals, child-care centers, senior-meal programs, and WIC food packages. It guides what foods the government buys for the military and federal cafeterias. It determines how SNAP educates low-income families about \"healthy choices.\" In other words, when federal nutrition guidelines shift, the food system shifts with them. And with this new food pyramid, the food system will shift toward producing a lot more beef and dairy-the most resource-intensive and climate-polluting foods we produce at scale.

Functional medicine doctors evaluate \"a matrix of fundamental causes,\" which allows them to understand your illness far, far better than a regular doctor. How does this work? Well, as explained by Dr. Jeffrey Bland , the guy who invented functional medicine back in 1991, functional medicine pulls in ideas and techniques from holistic medicine, alternative medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, complementary medicine, and Ayurvedic medicine, and brings them all together in a unified framework.

Epstein and President Donald J. Trump were close friends for many years, and the material the Department of Justice (DOJ) has released suggests that Trump was more closely tied to Epstein's activities than Trump has acknowledged. Although Trump ran in 2024 on the promise of releasing the Epstein files, suggesting those files would incriminate Democrats, his loyalists in the administration are now openly flouting the law to keep them hidden. Despite the clear requirement of the Epstein Files Transparency Act that they release all the files by December 19, to date they have released less than 1% of the material. Another part of the backstory of the past week is that the Supreme Court on December 23, 2025, rejected the Trump administration's argument that it had the power to deploy federalized National Guard troops in and around Chicago, a decision that seemed to limit Trump's power to use military forces within the United States.

There were fewer shooting victims in New York City than any other year on record even though there were ever so slightly more murder victims this year (around 300) than the historic low of 2017 (292).

Key Stats: Unemployment Rate: Fell to 4.38%, its lowest level since August (good) Nonfarm Payroll Employment: Rose by 50K in December, but big downward revisions to the prior two months (meh) Prime working age employment population ratio: inches up to 80.7% (good) The rest of this recap includes: The Big Picture Data Rundown Next Month: Benchmark Revision! More below chart. 1. The Big Picture December's jobs report was a good one - the 1st good one in a while. What do I mean by good? It certainly doesn't mean that everything is good in the labor market. Not everything in the report looked good. It doesn't negate the prior few jobs reports, which were bad. But it does, on the margin, change our perception of the state of the labor market: both where we are, and the pace at which we're moving. Where we are : the labor market has cooled a little bit in the past 6 months, but less than we previously thought. The pace at which we're moving: very gradually in the wrong direction, and a little more slowly than we previously thought. I've seen a lot of discourse on the report dwell on the meager employment growth - 50K in December, and only 584K in 2025 as a whole. For instance, you may have seen a chart like this, suggesting that 2025 was an unusually weak year for the labor market. I don't like that chart, because it is confounded by population growth. 2025 was a year with a big crackdown on immigration: both limiting who can come in, and trying to get people to leave. Simultaneously our population is aging. It's not surprising that in such an environment, you'd see much lower employment growth! You can't use this indicator to assess labor market health, at least from the perspective of slack. 1 2 A better perspective is looking at what happened to the unemp",

Photo by Look Studio on Unsplash A lot of readers tell me that my fundamental optimism about the world is one of the reasons they appreciate my blog. I think my usual sunny attitude springs from my above-average skill at resisting the negativity bias inherent in the media. It's very easy to read the news every day and conclude that the world is in a never-ending hydra-headed \" polycrisis \"; if you have a cool, detached perspective, you'll realize that things are rarely so dark. That said, this year I was a bit of a downer. The coming of the second Trump administration means the end of the era of stability that the world enjoyed after World War 2. Even if the U.S. can fix its domestic problems (which are not all Trump's fault by a long stretch), the ascendance of China and Russia as the world's dominant power bloc will not be so easily undone, and the ramifications of that shift are only getting started. That's what motivated the somewhat darker tone of my blog this year. But that doesn't mean I think the world is going to Hell in a handbasket. From India's resilient economic growth to Europe's timely rearmament to the ongoing technological revolutions in AI , electric technology , and biotech, there is plenty to be happy about. Even when it comes to American society, I see lots of quiet reasons for optimism. Our politics is dysfunctional and our media landscape resembles a demon-haunted wasteland, but underneath the surface, I see signs that our society is starting to knit itself back together after the unrest and chaos of 2014-2021. Health is improving. Violence is falling. Americans are starting to use technology more responsibly. Some of the economic sclerosis of the pre-pandemic years seems to be falling away. I suspect that there are \" macrosociological \" forces at work. To my knowledge, sociologists haven't really modeled a cycle of aggregate social division and health, 1 but if you look at events like the collapse of the USSR and the decade of violence and se",

A while back, I was talking to a friend about someone I had, at that point in time, very recently become acquainted with. We were discussing this person's sexual predilections - as you do, of course, when talking to your friends - and I mentioned in the course of conversation that the person in question was very kinky. Curious to know more, my friend asked about the specific areas of kinky interest held by this individual. \"Well, anal,\" I initially responded. \"Anal isn't kinky!\" my friend replied. I have been thinking about that exchange ever since. I want to clarify here that when I described this person as both \"very kinky\" and \"into anal,\" my point wasn't that they were some hardcore fetishist simply because happened to enjoy a rousing round of some good old fashioned up the butt. In this particular instance, I was talking about someone who was fascinated with the more extreme end of anal penetration: systematic trainings and anal expansion and penetrative elements of an eye popping girth. But I still think this question of, \"Is anal sex inherently kinky?\" is a good one to ponder. Is it possible to be into anal and still totally vanilla? What does that even mean? In the strictest sense of vanilla sex - the normative, and heteronormative, variety where you're doing missionary in the dark with the person you're legally wed to - I think anal absolutely counts as kinky, or at least non-vanilla, sex*. But if you expand your lens even slightly - and certainly if you expand it to include non-heterosexual sex - then the boundaries become even fuzzier. I, for one, can certainly imagine Pete and Chasten Buttigieg playing with each other's buttholes**. I cannot see the couple that cancelled a fundraiser at a gay bar over the presence of a stripper pole as engaging in anything remotely adjacent to kinky sex. I also can't really imagine someone showing up to their local fetish club purely because they've discovered a finger up the asshole feels pretty good; but I think that, ",

Photo by Mathieu Stern on Unsplash The energy was palpable that day as hundreds of people pushed into the hotel ballroom. Many wearing grey coveralls, smiling, hopeful and showing the conviction of their vision. The Chief Engineer was speaking that morning. The world was about to become a better place. It was 1933 in California. Nearly a century later, this time with hoodies and t-shirts with slogans, people similarly poured into a hotel ballroom. the Head of Engineering for one of the larger AI companies was about to speak. The world was about to become a better place. That first effervescent event in 1933 was for the Technocracy movement. The one in the early 2020's was the e/acc (Effective Accelerationist) movement. Both times, these movements held their deepest convictions that anyone who questions the plan simply doesn't understand technology, physics. So the names may change, but the pattern hasn't. This is an essay looking at the evolution of the Technocracy ideals to today's e/acc movement. It is not so much to criticise them as to help people understand this movement and also why, ultimately, e/acc will fail just Technocracy did. Not because of their ideology (that doesn't help) but because of the broader invisible hand of culture and the realities of being human. The Technocracy Movement This movement started around 1919, after WWI by Howard Scott , an American born in 1890. By 1931, with some others, he'd formed Technocracy Inc., which was created to promote his ideas of a society run by engineers as he considered a society run by government and industry as wasteful. Boiled down, Technocrats thought the idea of money was a bit silly, and that energy was a much better form of fiat. More measurable and understandable, more concrete. Are you picking up some inklings of cryptocurrencies, blockchain and modern day technofeudalism here? There's a reason for that. The ideas of technocracy received a fair bit of attention in the USA and Canada in the early 1930s ",

I'm still unclear what to make of #WaterTok, but I eventually settled on the idea that it's several subcultures overlapping - weight-loss communities, Mormons, and those people who don't like the \"taste\" of water. But in the majority of the #WaterTok videos I watched, people were using Stanley's Quencher to carry around their liquid Jolly Ranchers. And the ubiquity of the cup has sort of haunted me ever since. I grew up in the suburbs, but I don't live there anymore. So every time the great silent majority of American basicness summons a new totem to gather around, I can't help but try and make sense of it. Was this a car thing? A college football tailgate thing? An EDM thing? Cruise ships? Barstool Sports was of no help here, so I filed it away until this Christmas when it exploded across the web and forced me to finally figure out what the heck was going on. And it turns out, the Stanley cup's transformation into a must-have last year is actually, in many ways, the story of everything now. CNBC put together a great explainer on this. Stanley, a manly hundred-year-old brand primarily aimed at hikers and blue-collar workers, was rediscovered in 2019 by the bloggers behind a women's lifestyle and shopping site called The Buy Guide. They told CNBC that even though the Quencher model of the cup was hard to find, no other cup on the market had what they were looking for. Which is a bizarrely passionate stance to take on a water bottle, but from their post about the cup, those attributes were: \"Large enough to keep up with our busy days, a handle to carry it wherever we go, dishwasher safe, fits into our car cupholders, keeps ice cold for 12+ hours, and a straw.\" The Buy Guide team then sent a Quencher to Emily Maynard Johnson from The Bachelor after she had a baby because \"there is no thirst like nursing mom thirst!\" Johns",

President Trump addresses the nation from the White House on December 17, 2025. (Photo by Doug MILLS / POOL / AFP via Getty Images) On Wednesday night at 9 PM Eastern, President Trump delivered a prime time address to the nation that was aired by all major broadcast networks. It preempted the season finale of \"Survivor\" on CBS , one of the network's most highly-rated shows, the season finale of \"The Floor\" on Fox, and holiday specials on ABC and NBC. Typically, networks will interrupt their primetime schedule for presidents to address wars, crises, or very significant new policies. In his remarks on Wednesday, Trump delivered his standard talking points, bragging about his mass deportation policies and tariffs and attacking Democrats and the Biden administration. The only crisis was Trump's sagging approval ratings . \"Over the past 11 months, we have brought more positive change to Washington than any administration in American history,\" Trump said during the speech. \"There's never been anything like it.\" Trump blamed the Democrats for the increased cost of health insurance. \"You see that now in the steep increase in premiums being demanded by the Democrats, and they are demanding those increases, and it's their fault,\" he said. Millions of Americans will see their insurance rates increase after Republicans refused to extend government subsidies that will expire at the end of the year . The speech's partisan political content was not a surprise. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Trump would address the country \"about all of his historic accomplishments over the past year\" and \" all that he's done to bring our country back to greatness .\" Specifically, Leavitt stated that Trump would likely discuss \" border security and lower gas prices .\" The networks decided to break precedent and air it anyway.

Matthew Pittinsky has been on the front lines of the LMS world for three decades, beginning in 1995. An early participant in the Instructional Management Systems Project (IMS), a co-founder of Blackboard , a board member at Instructure , and now a senior executive at Anthology/Blackboard, Pittinsky occupies a unique vantage point-as a \"30-year observer and participant\" in LMS leadership. His two-part retrospective and prospective on the LMS is therefore must-reading. It offers rare insight into what has shaped \"LMS thinking\" over the past three decades-and what that thinking might look like in a world shaped by AI. The LMS at 30 In Part I, The LMS at 30: From Course Management to Learning Management (At Last) , Pittinsky begins by noting that 2025 \"marks a milestone in the Internet's impact on education: the 30th anniversary of the Learning Management System (LMS).\" He goes on to observe that none of the major technology platform shifts during this period-such as SaaS and mobile-fundamentally changed the LMS. Pittinsky reviews several other factors over this thirty-year span, but ultimately concludes: \"Today's LMS may be more scalable, prettier and easier to provision, but presented side-by-side, an LMS course Web site today closely resembles those from 1999. Indeed, it is remarkable how much even the strategic framing of today's LMS is the same as then.\" In other words, today's LMS is essentially the same system we had three decades ago. This is a stunning admission. A Stunning Admission-from the Inside It is stunning not because it comes from a critic of the LMS, but because it comes from someone who helped build it, scale it, and defend it for thirty years. Pittinsky is not arguing that the LMS fell short of its ambitions. He is acknowledging something more consequential: that, instructionally, the LMS never truly changed. In fact, the problem is worse than stasis. The core learning model did not stagnate-it never got off the ground. Across three decades, the LMS",

Also: Should this be a benchmark? We live in weird times. I tried to start this post repeatedly, with half a dozen different openings. And that's what I end up with: we live in weird times. Existing benchmarks for LLM performance are getting saturated. People run around saying meaningless things like \"This AI has moved from college senior level intelligence to PhD level intelligence.\" Other people hear these things and nod their heads. I look around and see the nodding and hear these meaningless phrases and think I'm losing my mind. Maybe you do too? I don't see myself as \"pro-AI\" or \"anti-AI.\" But I understand how the AI doubters feel. They read about the myriad successes of LLMs, and then they ask an LLM a question about something they actually know and get a bizarre answer. Pressed later for an example of an error, they can't remember, but they are pretty sure they see errors in output all the time. People tell them they are wrong and imagining things, that these issues were solved long ago. They feel a bit gaslit. I'm here to tell you the errors they see are real. I also know how the people boosting AI feel. If you've been paying attention to response quality over the last year it's been an amazing year of progress. Answers have gotten remarkably better. Yet AI doubters are talking about stalling progress. How is that possible? I think both of these issues stem - at least partially - from having a set of metrics that don't capture well the daily experience of these systems. Both in how they still malfunction horribly at weirdly basic things and in how they have dramatically improved over time. And I want to tell that story in a way that I hope will lead to greater d&#233;tente by discussing the 1992 comedy My Cousin Vinny .

But I had some time available between the end of classes and final exam submission. And I do love a good hateread. My standard approach is to create a reaction thread on Bluesky, and treat that as the first draft of a proper book review. Then I trim it down and turn it into a book review that resides on Substack. I don't see any point in turning the Nuzzi review into a substack post though. There have already been plenty of sharp - witted review , appropriately cataloguing the book's failings. I don't have much to add beyond the hyperlinks. ( My review thread starts here , for my non-bluesky-addicted readers). Instead, I'd like to take a step back and discuss hatereading as a genre. Because I'm clearly enjoying myself with this, but I've never paused to think through what it is exactly that I'm doing here. This is the eighth hateread-thread that I've composed this year. It has become something of a running bit. (A couple people referred to me this week as \"Bluesky's Omelas child\" and ohmygodIlovethat.)

That's usually not a problem when they're reporting, a highly structured activity that gives you the excuse of asking prying questions on behalf of your readers or even the general public. But it can be a problem when it comes time to network. Meeting up with other journalists at a social function? Self-promotion? Small talk? For the average introvert, those all sound exhausting. So how do you do it? By turning your natural instincts from a disadvantage into an advantage and using your skills as a reporter. We talked with Stephanie Thoma, a career coach who specializes in helping introverts , about some tips for networking for introverted journalists. Do some reporting: Look for some journalists likely to attend the event and read up on their background and their recent stories. Treat it like a potential interview. This will also give you something to talk about, which should reduce anxiety. Use social media: Find the contacts you're hoping to make on public-facing social media sites such as BlueSky or Threads and interact with them. This establishes some rapport for when you might meet in person in a low-stress way. Go early: There will be fewer people there, which can reduce your stress. It's also easier to chat with the handful of other early birds than trying to work a crowded room like an extrovert. Find the introverts: Look for the people hanging out on the edges of the room and strike up a conversation. They're probably introverts too and will be glad that you took the first step. Thoma recommends having a couple of staple openers: \"I call these conversational sponges: open ended, and inspiring further conversation. One of my favorites is &#8216;What's something you're looking forward to right now?'\" Have an elevator pitch: Try to come up with a brief description of who you are and what you do.

No pontificating-just practical and actionable advice. Zapier's CEO shares his personal AI stack Brought to you by Brex -The intelligent finance platform built for founders In this episode, Wade Foster (co-founder & CEO of Zapier) shares the actual way he's leading real AI adoption inside Zapier-by using it hands-on himself to understand company culture, evaluate candidates, and find talent most recruiters never see. We get concrete workflows Wade uses everyday: building interview-evaluation agents, using tools like Grok to surface diamonds-in-the-rough candidates, and analyzing meeting transcripts to uncover Zapier's \"unspoken culture.\" He also explains why AI fluency can't be delegated, how leaders should create safe \"play spaces\" for experimentation, and why the definition of \"top talent\" is rapidly changing. Biggest takeaways: CEOs must do more than write an \"AI memo.\" Wade sees many executives fall into the \"delegation trap\"-writing a memo about AI adoption then expecting it to filter down through the organization. Instead, leaders should create \"play spaces\" like hackathons and show-and-tells where teams can experiment with AI tools without pressure. You can build an interview evaluation agent in minutes. Wade demonstrated a simple Zapier agent that analyzes interview transcripts against job descriptions and company values, then recommends whether to advance candidates. This provides an unbiased second opinion that helps catch things human interviewers might miss. Use Grok to find \"diamonds in the rough\" talent. While most recruiters focus on LinkedIn, Wade uses Grok to search X/Twitter and YouTube for potential candidates who match specific criteria.

To become a person of intellectual competence, it is important to understand the history of one's own mind. This is arguably the root of all language, human thought, inventions, creativity, and ideas. Its understanding can be paramount to the mastery of everything else: from science and mathematics, to chess, critical thinking, or playing an instrument. Ultimate understanding requires teachings from the quintessence of man, and (for many) the omniscience of his Creator. Naturally, one turns to Carl Jung to evaluate his work on the psyche, which encompasses all conscious and unconscious processes. Theology, too, has a role to play in this, and is perhaps the elemental forum (alpha and omega) for understanding the mysteries of our mind. Other multidisciplinary factors (history, science and archaeology) also influence how our mental capacities came to be. But for the purposes of this article, psychology and theology will be the focal point. The Thinking Archive is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. The Trifecta Nature of Man The triune, as it is also called, is the view that man is composed of three distinct parts: the body, soul, and spirit. This primarily comes from Christian theology, and readers familiar with the Bible may recognise it from 1 Thessalonians 5:23. 1 Plato explored an idea of a triune in his work, &#8216; The Republic ' (c.375 BCE) and in &#8216; Phaedrus ', (c.370 BCE) where he conceptualised the soul by dividing it into three parts. 2 But simply speaking, the theological concept of the triune can be understood in this way: The body is our biology. It consists of the flesh, the senses, and the nervous system, and is the element that roots us in the material world. It is therefore perceptible to the physical, and deals with tactile, palpable matters. The soul is our mind. It is the part of man where reason is expressed using rationality and thought.

What they care about instead is a simpler, more practical question: why does so much confident planning fail so badly, even when it is done by clever people with good data and sophisticated tools? Why do policies that are carefully modelled, systems that are meticulously managed, and futures that are aggressively forecast so often dissolve into surprise, escalation, and excuse? We are told, repeatedly, that understanding is improving, that prediction is becoming more accurate, and that authority therefore deserves greater trust. This essay asks whether that inference is actually warranted. Chaos theory enters the discussion not as a technical curiosity, but as a hard-won lesson about the limits of foresight - and about what those limits do, and do not, entitle us to claim. We grow up absorbing a conviction so basic it is almost invisible: that to understand a rule is to gain advance sight. The kettle boils; the door opens; the clock advances. Learn how something works, and you can say what will happen next. The world appears to reward comprehension with foresight, as though intelligence were a kind of temporal privilege. This is not a philosophical doctrine so much as a habit of expectation, trained into us by a lifetime of small, obedient systems that behave as they are told. That habit rests on an assumption rarely stated aloud: that causes behave proportionally. Push a little, and a little happens. Push twice as hard, and twice as much follows. When things go wrong, they usually go wrong in recognisable ways. Errors remain modest, contained, civilised. Even failure is legible. In such a world, understanding feels like control delayed. Learn the rule, and the future yields - if not immediately, then eventually. For a long time, science assumed that this picture generalised.

Power-hungry, profit-obsessed tech elites like Elon Musk keep unleashing tools that bulldoze past basic safeguards and hard-won protections. Why?

Here's a long quote from Karpathy's October 17, 2025 interview with Dwarkesh Patel: Dwarkesh Patel 01:42:55 You've talked about how you were at Tesla leading self-driving from 2017 to 2022. And you firsthand saw this progress from cool demos to now thousands of cars out there actually autonomously doing drives. Why did that take a decade? What was happening through that time? Andrej Karpathy 01:43:11 One thing I will almost instantly push back on is that this is not even near done, in a bunch of ways that I'm going to get to. Self-driving is very interesting because it's definitely where I get a lot of my intuitions because I spent five years on it. It has this entire history where the first demos of self-driving go all the way to the 1980s. You can see a demo from CMU in 1986 . There's a truck that's driving itself on roads. Fast forward. When I was joining Tesla, I had a very early demo of Waymo. It basically gave me a perfect drive in 2014 or something like that, so a perfect Waymo drive a decade ago. It took us around Palo Alto and so on because I had a friend who worked there. I thought it was very close and then it still took a long time. For some kinds of tasks and jobs and so on, there's a very large demo-to-product gap where the demo is very easy, but the product is very hard. It's especially the case in cases like self-driving where the cost of failure is too high. Many industries, tasks, and jobs maybe do",

Diana's Substack is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. Because I don't know if Mo ever actually existed. For all I know, he may have been AI all along. His name has even been removed as co-author of the previous Palestine Clarity Manual posts. He no longer has a Substack account. We were using a google doc to write this manual, and yesterday I no longer had access to it. So I emailed him at what I assumed was his real name - Zaffar Hussain (zaffarh@gmail.com), the name he shared on Substack as his LinkedIn profile. Fair enough. I understand the privacy concerns. When I checked Substack today, there was no trace of this person, who had listed himself as a retired government employee from California. There was, however, a listing for someone on LinkedIn by this name who was the CEO of HYZ Energy of Qatar. At one point during the recent holiday season, he emailed me to say he'd be returning to Ireland from Scotland in a few days so wouldn't be working on the manual at that time.

Acta Populi - Number XIV Sappho and Alcaeus, 1881, by Lawrence Alma-Tadema (1836&#8211;1912) Now here's a subject that's going to get your attention! There's going to be some exciting language in this, which I have kept a bit adult, because that is very much the context in which it was meant. So be warned! In Roman society, sexual activity was understood primarily in terms of dominance, power, and social order rather than boring old personal pleasure on its own. Roman discourse on sex frequently emphasised penetrative acts, hierarchical roles, and the public perception of sexual morality. Female-to-female sexual acts, therefore, were judged through this slightly skewed view of activity and power. For Roman authors, sex was often defined in quite functional and hierarchical terms. Penetration was the central concept, frequently associated with the active, dominant role of the penetrator. Sexual acts without penetration were sometimes dismissed as incomplete or ineffective in establishing social meaning (Veyne, 1990). As these acts were seen to be incomplete, it was considered that sex had not really occurred. This central concept still remains in some Western laws, such as in the UK, where &#8216;rape' is defined as penetration with a penis. Anything else is &#8216;sexual assault'. The framework of dominance and submission was integral to Roman sexual ideology: the penetrator held power, while the receptive partner assumed a subordinate position. In this context, sexual acts between women presented an ambiguity, as neither partner fit the traditional hierarchy. Both could be dominant, both could be subservient, both could be neither, and to Romans, this made no sense as a sexual act. It was, in effect, &#8216;messing around'. Martial's Epigrams provide some of the most direct literary references to female-female sexual acts. In Epigrams 7.67, Martial writes of Philaenis, a lesbian, who has fun getting up to all sorts of mischief with boys and girls. She sodomises boys, refuses to give men bl",

Credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, Ralf Crawford (STScI) What if we told you there's a planet out there so blisteringly hot that its entire surface is a churning sea of molten rock &#8211; yet it somehow manages to hold onto a thick, steamy atmosphere? That's the jaw-dropping revelation from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, which has just given us the clearest evidence yet of air on a rocky exoplanet this extreme. Meet TOI-561 b, a super-Earth that's rewriting the playbook on planetary survival. This isn't some sci-fi fever dream; it's real data from Webb's NIRSpec instrument, peering at a world orbiting its star in under 11 hours. The dayside? A global magma ocean glowing at temperatures that would vaporize steel. But instead of being a barren, airless husk like we expected, TOI-561 b is wrapped in a volatile-rich blanket &#8211; think water vapor, carbon dioxide, and maybe even silicate clouds acting like a cosmic shield. The team behind this, led by Johanna Teske from Carnegie Science, was stunned. \"What really sets this planet apart is its anomalously low density,\" Teske explained in the new paper out today. At 1.4 times Earth's size but with a puffier build, it hinted at something more than just rock and iron. Webb's 37-hour stare-down confirmed it: the planet's dayside is \"only\" 1,800&#176;C, way cooler than the 2,700&#176;C predicted for bare lava. That cooling? Winds whipping heat around, gases absorbing infrared light, and clouds reflecting starlight back to space. Why does this matter? For starters, it flips the script on ultra-short-period exoplanets &#8211; those hellish worlds we thought were doomed to lose their air billions of years ago. TOI-561 b orbits a star twice the Sun's age in a metal-poor corner of the galaxy, so it might be a fossil from the Universe's early days. \"It's really like a wet lava ball,\" says co-author Tim Lichtenberg f",

At the Edge of Becoming: From Simplicity to Complexity, And Back.

We do not know whether the Big Bang was a true beginning. It may have been the origin of everything, or it may have emerged from the end state of something else-a collapse, a transition, a phase change beyond our present capacity to describe. We do not know what preceded it, if anything did, nor whether the frameworks we use to model it will survive future discoveries. Our knowledge of the universe is partial, provisional, and subject to revision. More unsettling still, we do not know the shape or scale of what we do not know. Modern cosmology-from dark matter and dark energy to quantum behavior that resists classical intuition-reminds us how incomplete our understanding remains. And yet, imperfect as it is, some understanding exists. Something happened. \"Systems that reduce constraint also concentrate risk, and when complexity grows faster than coordination, collapse becomes a feature rather than a failure.\" Roughly 13.8 billion years ago-according to our best current measurements and models-the observable universe emerged from an early phase we can only partially reconstruct. In that phase, matter and energy behaved in ways that appear, from our limited vantage point, relatively simple compared with the complexity that followed. Whether this apparent simplicity was fundamental, emergent, or merely an artifact of incomplete theory remains unknown. What followed, as far as we can observe, was the emergence of structure.

On December 8, 2025, the USDA announced the Farmer Bridge Assistance (FBA) Program. The program will provide $12 billion in one-time assistance payments to producers of specific crops, including barley, chickpeas, corn, cotton, lentils, oats, peanuts, peas, rice, sorghum, soybeans, wheat, canola, crambe, flax, mustard, rapeseed, safflower, sesame, and sunflower. Farmers were required to file their acreage reports by December 19, 2025 to be eligible, and the USDA expects to release payments by the end of February 2026. On December 31, 2025 , USDA announced payment rates for specific commodities. An article from Farmdoc Daily of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has outlined that the program payments will be calculated by simply multiplying the number of acres planted to a specific commodity to the corresponding payment rate. An operation that grew 500 acres of cotton will see a payment of $58,675 ($117.35 x 500) and an operation that grew 312 acres of soybeans would receive a payment of $9,635 ($30.88 x 312). Farmdoc provided an example of a farm in Illinois in their analysis: \"A farm with 50% of its acres planted to corn and the other half planted to soybeans would receive an average FBA payment of $37.62 per acre (0.5 x $44.36 + 0.5 x $30.88). The average size of a grain farm enrolled in Illinois Farm Business Farm Management (FBFM) is roughly 1,500 acres. Total FBA payments for the average grain farm with only owned and cash rented acres in Illinois with 750 acres planted to corn and 750 acres planted to soybeans in 2025 would be $56,430 ($44.36 x 750 corn acres plus $30.88 x 750 soybean acres).\" USDA's fact sheet sets payment limitation for the program at $155,000 per producer and only operations making less than $900,000 in adjusted gross income will be eligible for the program. This is very consistent with other Farm Service Agency commodity programs. USDA has outlined that acres which were prevented from being planted are ineligible for FBA. By exclu",

Meanwhile, the right had coalesced not just around removing Newsom, but around replacing him with Larry Elder, the most popular conservative on the ballot, a talk radio host whose following appeared to be boosting him in the polls. In the end, 6.1 million Californians voted to keep Newsom, and 3.4 million voted to remove him, a 63.7 percent to 36.3 percent margin. The question now is: What to make of it?

Its market share hovered near 40 percent, its margins were envied across Europe, and its brand was a symbol of reliability. Inside the company's sprawling Espoo campus, engineers spoke in the language of precision and process. Decisions were documented, metrics tracked, and procedures refined. Nokia didn't improvise; it executed. But then came the iPhone. What followed wasn't a single transformation, it was a dozen. Between 2005 and 2010, Nokia reorganized its leadership structure six times. It spun up new software divisions, launched competing internal projects, and replaced process after process in a desperate attempt to rediscover its agility. On paper, the company was moving fast. In reality, it was exhausting itself. According to a case study by Harvard Business Review titled Nokia: The Inside Story of the Rise and Fall of a Technology Giant , the pace of internal change became so relentless that employees stopped resisting it altogether. \"We were constantly reorganizing,\" one executive recalled, \"but never really improving.\" Managers grew fearful of voicing skepticism because tomorrow's process might make today's priorities irrelevant. Even when engineers recognized the threat of Apple's software ecosystem, they had no energy left to fight through another round of reorgs. The company's culture didn't calcify, it frayed. That's how Nokia lost the race it had once dominated. It didn't die from complacency. It died from exhaustion. And that exhaustion has a name. Researchers call it the acceleration trap , a state where organizations push so hard to stay adaptive that they outpace their own ability to absorb change. A similar pattern appears in research published by the American Psychological Association , which reports that workers experiencing recent or current change were more than twice as likely to report chronic work stress compared with employee",

    "text": "Enacting Courage Pulling Up the Tangled Roots of Injustice Its a new year and a time for setting intentions. On New Year's Day 2022, I set an intention to express more interpersonal warmth and I refreshed that intention each year thereafter - until this year. Since the 2024 election I've been feeling the need for enacting more courage . Just writing this down creates a stirring in the core of my body, so I know its an edge. Putting things to paper helps increase my commitment. Enacting courage is my intention for 2026. As I understand it, courage means facing fear, difficulty, uncertainty - a willingness to risk. And the kind of courage I would like to cultivate involves more than a single act of heroism in a rare emergency - like running into a house on fire to save a child. I wish to build the fortitude to stay - to hold the line of my aspirational values. I've learned over the years that true confidence (unlike bravado or hubris) arises out of enacted courage, and I certainly could use a bigger dose of that.

Pulling Up Poison Roots This summer I moved into a home with a yard and I've been overjoyed to have a piece of dirt to put my hands into. Part of it was overgrown with invasive honeysuckle. I've only relatively recently learned this plant was imported as a yard ornament that escaped gardens due to its incredibly \"self-dealing\" qualities, for which our local environment is not well-adapted. This type of honeysuckle releases chemicals that inhibit the growth of native plants, altering soil chemistry and microorganisms, making it hard for other species to thrive. Its berries offer little to no nutrition to wildlife and its shallow roots compete for water, sunlight and nutrients, creating bare soil vulnerable to erosion. When allowed to proliferate unchecked it will deplete resources, significantly reduce biodiversity, and negatively impact the health of the ecosystem. S",

It all kicked off on December 12th, when X user @ZeroSuitCamus posted a video with the caption, \"Just made this video. Let me know what you think!\" The video was a short animation from the artist JoCat. You can watch it below: The @ZeroSuitCamus joke post was a classic Twitter gag. You find something your followers will immediately recognize as cringe and ironically claim that you made it. And @ZeroSuitCamus's followers knew exactly what to do. Their post has over a thousand replies and almost two thousand shares. And the majority are extremely vicious, with many going so far as to claim JoCat is a child abuser - for liking cartoons, I guess? Defining the groups involved here is tricky in the way defining any cluster of internet users never feels quite right, but I would broadly say that @ZeroSuitCamus and their followers are loose coalition of Weird Twitter users, trans shitposters, and dirtbag leftists (if those people even still exist). While JoCat's fans are, well, goofy YouTube nerds, adult cartoon fans, and queer gamers. By the end of the discourse cycle, @ZeroSuitCamus has since sorta-kinda apologized for the post, while also blaming JoCat for amplifying it in the first place. And JoCat published a lengthy blog post explaining the context behind the \"I Like Girls\" video. It was an inside joke , riffing on Lizzo's \"Boys\". \"I still want to make things, but perhaps I should just keep them to myself for the time being,\" JoCat wrote. \"I will be taking an indefinite break from posting anything online. It's a decision I've considered ever since the first hate wave from about a year or so ago but wanted to sit on it and see if the feeling would persist. I know now this is the best choice for me.\" I assumed our Bean Dad days were dying out with Twitter. And, to be clear, this is absolutely not at that level. But I also think ",

Courtesy of The Fourth Law \"A fully autonomous drone will be like a grenade: every soldier with basic skills will be able to use it; it will operate under intense electronic warfare and function as a highly precise weapon,\" says Yaroslav Azhnyuk, founder of The Fourth Law, Ukraine's leading developer of autonomous defence technologies. Despite significant hype, such systems are not yet widely present on the Russia&#8211;Ukraine battlefield. However, a future in which drones fly over cities like Kyiv or Moscow, autonomously selecting targets based on predefined criteria, or both sides deploy dense \"wall-to-wall\" waves of drones, no longer feels distant. I'm glad to finally publish this article on The Fourth Law, a driving force behind Ukraine's autonomous defence tech. Subscribe now The Fourth Law (TFL) was founded in 2023 by Yaroslav Azhnyuk . As many of Ukraine's defence-tech developers, Yaroslav was previously a highly successful civilian entrepreneur. His earlier venture, Petcube, was valued at $36&#8211;50 million by Forbes in 2021. Petcube is a global leader in pet cameras (with over 1M devices shipped), which enable owners to monitor, play with, and feed their pets remotely. In November 2023, Azhnyuk transitioned into the miltech sector and founded two companies: The Fourth Law (TFL) , which develops autonomous solutions, and Odd Systems , which focuses on thermal cameras for FPVs. Both companies also produce FPV drones. The Fourth Law team brings together engineers, scientists, and military veterans, with offices across Ukraine, the EU, and the United States. The company's name references a hypothetical \"fourth law of robotics\" - an idea meant to extend the three famous laws formulated by Isaac Asimov. The Fourth Law (TFL) has a public roadmap toward a new paradigm of warfare: Last-Mile Terminal Guidance Autonomous Bombing Guidance Autonomous Search and Destroy Full Navigation in GPS-De",

They explore the generational gap in expertise within the industry, the importance of optimizing workforce efficiency, and the collaboration between NAVSEA and the Maritime Industrial Base Program. The discussion also touches on legislative support needed for modern shipbuilding and the challenges faced in submarine maintenance and production. You can listen at this link , or using the Spotify widget below Showlinks U.S. Navy Partners with Palantir to Modernize Shipbuilding Supply Chain and Accelerate Shipbuilding The Maritime Industrial Base Program How big is the Columbia SSBN? Takeaways AI and software can enhance traditional shipbuilding processes. ShipOS integrates various aspects of shipyard operations. Bridging the generational gap is crucial for shipbuilding. Workforce efficiency can be optimized through better planning. Legislative support is needed for consistent funding in shipbuilding. Software tools can help decision-makers understand costs better.

Regardless of how the Ukraine-Russia war ends, there would be, I believe, inevitably serious geopolitical consequences for Russia. And they would be due to the way that Mr. Putin had decided to initiate and to prosecute this war. The first consequence that many people focus on is the long-term break in political and economic relations between Europe and Russia. This is indeed a big loss for both sides because through their different economic structures and resource endowments they are natural economic partners. Both parts of the Eurasian continent were gaining from economic collaboration. Theirs is not just a standard case of Ricardian comparative advantage but even more compelling case of Smithian absolute advantage because in the production of some primary goods Russia was absolutely more efficient than the European Union while on the other hand, in the industrial areas and in some forms of advanced technology (avionics, fast trains, pharmaceuticals), Europe possessed absolute advantage. A commerce based on gas and oil on one hand and industrial products on the other hand, would be, and was, mutually beneficial. That commerce will not be revived for any foreseeable future and surely not in the magnitudes which existed before the war. The cultural proximity between Russia and Europe, which was in existence for at least three hundred years, will be much weaker. That would have a cost principally for Russia because it would exclude it from European intellectual developments. Russia is indeed a big country and it does have its own intellectual tradition but one cannot nowadays intellectually grow just by looking at what is happening in his own backyard. Russia has been, since at least Peter the Great, ideologically influenced by European intellectual fashions and mores, was always keen to learn, and then to apply it in a new and unique manner. This has produced writers, composers, philosophers, painters and scientists of worldwide caliber. The loss would be Europe's t",

    "text": "AI: Samsung vs Apple global 'AI' smartphone race RTZ #958 ...world loves global AI distribution via Smartphone races Looks like Google Gemini AI is getting a distribution boost from Samsung Galaxy smartphones and devices that is bigger than might be understood. The reason this is important is of course the market fixation in this AI Tech Wave on the OpenAI vs Google LLM AI chatbot race. And the underlying global smartphone races that will now drive them. These are the kinds of races the world loves. And the fact that 2026 is the year of competition via DISTRIBUTION between the major LLM AI companies. Not just in the technical features of the underlying LLM AIs and chatbots that's been the primary driver of this race thus far. OpenAI is said to have 900 million weekly users of its GPT/ChatGPT 5.2 and earlier versions of AI services. That compares with a recent number of 650+ million for Google Gemini 3 and earlier versions . I'm on record with my 2026 AI Predictions on our AI Ramblings podcast, that Google with Gemini AI powering its global Google Search Services could reach 2 billion or more mainstream users, by year-end 2026. Samsung at CES 2026 announced their plans to boost Google Gemini distribution this year and beyond, and the numbers are interesting to say the least. Reuters lays it out in \" Samsung to double AI mobile devices to 800 million units this year\" : \"Samsung's mobile devices with \"Galaxy AI\" features will double to 800 mln units this year, co-CEO says\" \"Galaxy AI is powered by Google's Gemini, Samsung's own Bixiby assistant\" \"Co-CEO says Samsung not immune to \"unprecedented\" memory chip shortage\" The key item of course is the first point, which is a Samsung flex of its &#8216;Galaxy AI' Smartphones vs Apple's iPhone line-up. Now both phones are featuring Gemini AI as their underlying LLM AI chatbot technology. \"Samsung Electronics plans to double this year the number of its mobile devices with \"Galaxy AI\" features largely powered by Google's Gemini, its co-CEO said, which would give the U.S. firm an edge over rivals as the global race in artificial intelligence h",

    "text": "The State of Search & AI: 2025 Usage and 2026 Predictions What actually matters when machines do the searching AI didn't replace discovery systems. It changed how people interact with them. Most of the industry spent 2025 missing this distinction entirely. Teams experimented with prompts, dashboards, and new acronyms. AI felt like a new surface that must be \"optimised for\"-quickly, before someone else figured it out first. Most of this activity was driven by uncertainty rather than evidence. It still is. (The conference circuit did very well out of it, though.) The Inference is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. That phase will fade. AI stops being novel and starts being ambient. The tools don't disappear-the anxiety around them does. And once that happens, a quieter truth becomes obvious: the fundamentals that determine whether information is found, trusted, and reused haven't actually changed. From experimentation to default behaviour Right now, AI sits beside existing workflows. People ask it questions they used to type into Google. They test how often their brand appears in answers. They screenshot wins. But default behaviour looks different from experimentation. When AI becomes infrastructure, users stop exploring and start delegating. Queries get shorter, more decisive, and less forgiving. The intent shifts from \"show me options\" to \"just tell me.\" That change doesn't reward clever optimisation tricks. It rewards clarity. When machines have to choose what to retrieve, summarise, or cite, ambiguity becomes a liability. Content that tries to do too many things at once quietly disappears. Content that explains one thing well, from a clear point of view, gets reused-not because it's clever, but because it's dependable. AI-generated answers don't create a new search system A lot of the \"AI Optimisation\" discussion assumes we're dealing with a new ranking logic. In practice, most of the predictable behaviour we see in AI-generated answers comes from retrieval, not generation. When an AI syste",

Sometimes we take a break from stories about human-spaceship sex monstrosities and poems on industrial abuses , and instead bring readers pieces about what's good and worth nurturing in this world. Marisca Pichette's poem \" fritillary frigate \" is one such work. It's a sweet adventure undertaken by two friends; it toes the line between science fiction and fairy tale. A dreamlike journey that feels like a childhood story - the kind you make up during playtime about the objects and creatures you encounter. In a timeline where space travel has become synonymous with billionaire dilettantism and large-scale waste, sometimes it's worth revisiting alternatives - worlds where it doesn't have to be this way. Pichette's travelers are guided by wonder, friendship, and a love of the natural world. Find the poem below, and keep reading for our breakdown and a whimsical glossary. Read it here Marisca Pichette is a queer author of more than three hundred pieces of short fiction and poetry, appearing in Strange Horizons, Clarkesworld, Vastarien, The Deadlands, The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, Fantasy Magazine, Asimov's, Nightmare Magazine , and many others. Her poetry collection, Rivers in Your Skin, Sirens in Your Hair , was a finalist for the Bram Stoker and Elgin Awards. Their eco-horror novella, Every Dark Cloud , is out now from Ghost Orchid Press. (You can find a catalogue of their poetry here .) From the beginning of the poem, \"Cockle & Foxfire / built a spaceship&#8230;\", Pichette leans into mystery and mood rather than explanation. We don't know who or what Cockle and Foxfire are - they seem to be small, since they're building with such tiny materials.

    "text": "A Conversation Across Species How one parrot reshaped views on animal intelligence In the 1970s, a commonly held belief, especially among non&#8211;pet owners, was that animals were essentially automatons, reacting to stimuli but lacking the abilities to think or feel. Animal psychologist Irene Pepperberg sought to test the theory. In 1977, she brought Alex, an African gray parrot-a species famed for its mimicry-into her Brandeis University lab. She began an experiment that would eventually blur the boundary between human animal and nonhuman animal minds. One of the ways Pepperberg taught Alex was through the Model/Rival technique, where two humans interacted in front of him so he could observe words used purposefully rather than merely repeated. Within a few years, Alex had a working vocabulary of more than a hundred words. Alex could identify objects by color, shape, or material-and even combine those concepts when asked questions like, \"What color three-corner wood?\" correctly answering \"green.\" He could infer absence, identifying a missing color through the process of elimination, demonstrating logic-based reasoning. When shown two items and asked, \"Which is bigger?\" or \"Which is greener?\" he chose accurately. He understood abstract ideas like \"same,\" \"different,\" and even \"none,\" correctly answering \"none\" when asked how many green keys were among a group of colored keys. He could also group objects conceptually (e.g., all keys as \"metal,\" all fruits as \"food\"). Alex grasped the concept of individual identity; when researchers asked him which bird they were pointing to, he would appropriately answer \"Alex\" for himself or name another bird-like \"Griffin\" or \"Arthur.\" He identified letters by sound, not just shape. When Pepperberg showed him a written letter and asked, \"What sound?\" Alex could produce the correct phoneme, indicating phonological awareness-an ability linked to early literacy in humans. He created words for unfamiliar objects by joining elements of known objects; he came up with \"banerry\" the first time he saw an apple, apparentl",

Chris Morris's interview with Channel 4 on the subject from 2019 highlights one of the great perils of not having this more defined target and message: The reason I bring this up, in a post about Casino Roguelikes, is that I feel like games have a unique wrinkle in this conversation: Their ability to mimic the psychological effects of their real world counterparts through their more immersive ludic qualities. The focal point has almost always been around violence and propaganda, and these aspects have been debated to death over many decades. The question of &#8216;do videogames incite violence?' met with a reasonable conclusion of &#8216;not really'. Gambling, on the other hand, has a far more worrying foothold in the industry.

They are a sort of German analog of Michael Shermer's Skeptic Magazine. The interview is presented below in full. My interviewers fully referenced it (references at end) but I have added one reference, some additional links, some parenthetical commentary for missing details I thought relevant and an occasional image that does not appear in the original article. Nothing else has been changed.

Unsafe Science is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. TS: As skeptics, we care about pseudoscience, but also about exaggerated or plainly false claims. Which social-science findings are misrepresented the most, be it in academia or in public? LJ: There are many. One standard narrative is that women face pervasive barriers, especially in STEM. An amazing 2023 paper ( 1 ) by a large team complicates that story. The team conducted a meta-analysis (a study that statistically combines results from multiple studies) on decades of audit studies. Audit studies are field experiments that send companies identical fake male and female applications for real jobs to see who gets callbacks for an interview. This is the gold standard in research on hiring discrimination. In earlier decades, there were consistent anti-female biases. By around 2009, these effects had faded or even slightly reversed, with small anti-male effects appearing in female-typical jobs, such as nursing, and no bias in most other fields.

Become one &#11015;&#65039; Subscribe to PN An Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed Renee Good, age 37, in broad daylight in Minneapolis yesterday. Despite Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blathering about how ICE agents are under assault and President Donald Trump's outright fiction that Good ran over the agent and put him in the hospital, anyone with eyes can see it was murder. There's video, which is how we all know that DHS and Trump are lying, but seeing someone get murdered by the government is not an easy thing to watch. MPR News posted the footage, but this is just a reminder that you don't have to subject yourself to the horror to know it is a horror. What you see on the video it is a federal agent demanding Good get out of the car, at which point she starts driving her SUV forward at about five miles per hour. That's when an ICE agent near the front of her car fires multiple shots into Good's vehicle, killing her. In another video - which, again, is really tough to watch - a bystander yells that he's a physician and asks to render aid, to which the agent responds, \"I don't care.\" So what we have here is a federal law enforcement officer firing into a car at an unarmed person driving away slowly, and then other federal officers refusing to let someone come to her aid. It's absolutely terrible and a disgrace to our nation. But can the officer who killed Good ever be held accountable for his actions?

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) In an extraordinary letter sent to a federal judge Monday evening, Attorney General Pam Bondi admitted that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has not disclosed more than 99% of the files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein - despite a federal law that required full disclosure by December 19, 2025. According to the letter, the DOJ \"has now posted to the DOJ Epstein Library webpage approximately 12,285 documents (comprising approximately 125,575 pages).\" Meanwhile, \"there are more than 2 million documents potentially responsive to the Act that are in various phases of review.\" The number of undisclosed documents has nearly doubled since the last DOJ statement, on December 24, which claimed that one million Epstein-related documents had not been released. The failure to release these documents is a violation of the Epstein Files Transparency Act , which was signed into law by President Trump on November 19. The law requires Bondi to \"make publicly available in a searchable and downloadable format all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials in the possession of the Department of Justice\" related to Epstein within 30 days. The law allows the DOJ to redact records that \"contain personally identifiable information of victims,\" material depicting child sex abuse, and other sensitive information. Each redaction \"must be accompanied by a written justification published in the Federal Register and submitted to Congress.\" Many of the limited number of documents that have been released are heavily redacted. One document that was \"released\" is 100 blacked-out pages . But the DOJ has not provided a written justification for any redaction.

    "text": "Does Manufacturing Matter? Does manufacturing matter? Thinking about trade offs around deindustrialization The Economist , in a recent survey of Europe's economic woes, sparked a minor controversy by urging the continent to adjust to intense Chinese competition in manufacturing by reorienting toward services. \"De-industrialization,\" it argued, \"need not be synonymous with decay.\" The argument goes like this: rich economies are rich because of high value-add services. America is the least industrial (measured by manufacturing as % GDP) of all big economies, but also the richest. One reason that Germany and Japan are relatively more industrial is because they never developed much of a software industry. They're more industrial partly because their manufacturers are relatively more successful (eg, their auto firms retained more market share the US ones over the past few decades) but also partly because they've underperformed in high value services. Here's auto manufacturing, where the US has dramatically underperformed the trend (data from Gemini): And here's software market cap and market share, also from Gemini. Ask \"would you rather have: 1) a world in which GM performed as well as Volkswagen over the past 30 years or 2) Silicon Valley?\" the answer is obvious. Perhaps that's an unfair phrasing of the question, assuming that the only options were to either double down on an aged-out industrial base or to deindustrialize in favor of software. Was there an alternative? Peter Thiel has quipped that we were promised flying cars and instead got 140 characters. Could we have redirected talent to produce less social media and more SpaceX? I'm unsure, though I'd note that Elon's initial fortune came from enabling online shopping (PayPal) and Peter Thiel was an early Facebook investor. Palmer Luckey founded Anduril after he'd already sold a business to Facebook. It's not easy to separate America's titans of deep tech from the profits of the internet economy.

Photo: Mark Mitchell / Getty Images Briefly in the news from Aotearoa's political economy on Wednesday, December 17: Treasury published its Half Yearly Economic and Financial Update (HYEFU) report yesterday, lowering its GDP growth forecast, raising its unemployment forecast, reducing the Government's tax revenue forecasts and delaying its forecast for a return to surplus by another year to 2029/30. Finance Minister Nicola Willis pledged the Government would stick to its strategy of restraining Government spending growth to crunch the size of core Crown spending below 30% of GDP from almost 33% now, in order to cut borrowing. She hopes this reduces mortgage rates to grow the economy faster. That strategy depends on households and businesses stepping up to borrow, spend and invest to offset the Government withdrawal, as they did through similar fiscal tightenings in the early 1990s, the early 2000s and the early 2010s. But those expansions were mostly driven by households taking on more debt to spend and invest in residential land. That was possible because household debt was much lower then than today, banks were still shifting from mostly business lending to mostly mortgage lending, and mortgage rates dropped substantially each time. Household debt to disposable income rose from under 50% of disposable income in 1989 when mortgage rates averaged around 15%, to a peak of 179% in 2009 after mortgage rates fell to 5.5%. Another surge in lending came as interest rates sagged towards 5% before LVR controls in 2013 and higher bank capital requirements stopped the rise in indebtedness. There was another bounce back in household-debt-to-disposable-income of 175% in 2022 as mortgage rates fell as low as 3%, but the rise in mortgage rates to around 7.5% by late 2023 stopped any further rise. In my view, the Government's strategy isn't working because households simply can't take on much more debt, ban",

Some folks in Wisconsin have figured out a way to give charter schools extra extra funding. Assembly Bill 818 creates a whole new kind of charter school (a wealthy kind). Currently (as explained in the bill analysis), the Office of Educational Opportunity in the University of Wisconsin System can authorize charter schools. The law sets a per-student amount that the charter school is paid; for 2025-26, that amount is $12,369. That's the amount for a regular old charter school, what Wisconsin calls an \"independent charter school.\" The bill proposes that the director of OED could designate a charter school a \"demonstration public school operator,\" and that any such school would be paid an additional $6,863 per pupil-- over 50% more than an ordinary charter school. (Both amounts would be adjusted annually). The bill explains what a charter would have to do to score this extra-renumerative designation: [T]o be designated as an demonstration public school operator, an independent charter school operator must demonstrate to the OEO director that it meets specific criteria, including that for each of its charter schools authorized by the OEO, the operator participates in a longitudinal study; provides professional development opportunities; disseminates best practices from its educational model to other schools; and establishes and maintains partnerships with community organizations. In short, the charter school must do all the things that charter boosters always said they were going to do. Study and share what works? We were told repeatedly that charter schools would be pedagogical laboratories, where cool new educational miracles would be nurtured and then turned loose. Professional development? You mean there are charter schools that don't tell their staff anything at all about how to do the job? Maintain partnerships with community organizations?

For a decade, defense analysts had been warning about Venezuela's Russian-made S-300 system, calling it the \"Russian Shield,\" a mobile beast capable of shooting down cruise missiles from 150 miles away, the kind of hardware that was supposed to sink American warships before they could even get close. Here's how it actually went down: The Navy jammed Venezuela's radars with so much electronic noise that operators couldn't see anything, forcing them to crank up their power just to pierce through the static. The moment they did, those radars lit up like beacons, and U.S. Anti-Radiation Missiles locked onto the signal and followed it home.

    "text": "Today on Lawfare: Jan. 8, 2026 From Lawfare's Editorial Team. Compiled by Marissa Wang and Isabel Arroyo . Articles Inside the Legal Battles Ahead for Nicol&#225;s Maduro Anna Bower , Eric Columbus , Michael Feinberg , Natalie K. Orpett , and Molly Roberts examined the charges facing Venezuelan President Nicol&#225;s Maduro and the potential challenges available to Maduro in his defense, including illegal arrest, head of state immunity, and improper venue. The authors assessed how each challenge, especially in a case of such unprecedented nature, may test the boundaries of longstanding legal doctrines. The conflicting interpretations of these events will unfold in the form of criminal litigation. The government's indictment of Maduro provides the specifics of what it must prove to convict-and for its narrative to prevail. But Maduro can raise a variety of defenses. While each appears to face an uphill battle due to existing case law, there is reason to take the arguments seriously; the unprecedented nature of Maduro's case may make it distinguishable from other quasi-analogous cases, of which there are few, some non-binding. In other words, it's a case ripe for creative legal argumentation. Whether the parties' litigation strategies lean into that opportunity will play out in court. The U.K.'s Plan for Electronic Eavesdropping Poses Cybersecurity Risks Susan Landau , Matt Blaze , and Steven M. Bellovin examined two ways the U.K. government's vague order requiring Apple to grant them \"access to encrypted cloud backups of U.K. citizens\" might operate in practice. The authors explained how either approach would raise significant logistical problems and jeopardize the country's cybersecurity, potentially enabling adversarial actors to gain access to sensitive information. Indeed, the U.K. appears to be more preoccupied with criminal actors than the People's Republic of China and other sophisticated, adversarial nation-states. Or so it would seem given the most recent salvo by the U.K. government regarding the use of Apple's Advanc",

Three days in, 1,925 Substack readers have donated a total of $922,654 toward our $1M goal. Because the momentum has been so strong, we've decided to raise the target to encourage folks to keep giving through the end of the month. Literature shows thermometers are most impactful at 66-80% full. You'll see the fundraising thermometer update shortly! 102 of your readers contributed $28,652.

At the 2025 Energy Business Summit at the University of Southern California Marshall School of Business, billionaire mining entrepreneur Robert Friedland delivered a tour de force dissertation on critical minerals and the raw materials supply chain. His message was clear and sobering: The world has an insatiable thirst for metals, from surging military budgets to AI data centers and the greening of the global economy, but it does not have a credible way to supply the metals it intends to consume over the next few decades. The United States is totally dependent on China for almost every critical mineral. A sampling of the soundbites that I found to be the most insightful and entertaining: \" In this country, people think a ham sandwich comes from a refrigerator. People that are highly educated and live in urban centers, they go to the refrigerator, they open it up, they take the ham sandwich out of the refrigerator. There's 30 million pigs a month being slaughtered in a river of blood outside Chicago.\" \"The price of scandium has no where to go but up.\" Friedland has been pounding the table on scandium recently, including an appearance on Bloomberg . Friedland is Co-Chairman and a non-executive director of Sunrise Energy Metals Ltd. (ASX: SRL), he is also the largest shareholder with a ~19% stake based on the latest reporting. Sunrise's Syerston Scandium Project in New South Wales, Australia is one of the world's largest undeveloped scandium resources with 19,000 tonnes of contained scandium metal in resource. On the daunting scale of copper the world needs to produce over the next two decades: \"You can't build electric cars and windmills and solar and have a modern military without these metals. So, there's a reason why underwater power cables are so expensive. That's what it looks like when you put up a windmill offshore Nantucket Island and you want to bring that electricity and be green .

Front page, below the fold, Sunday edition, written by David Fahrenthold and Claire Brown. The title tells you all you need to know about both the thesis and the tone: \" The Sierra Club Embraced Social Justice. Then It Tore Itself Apart. \" I served on the Sierra Club's Board of Directors from 2004-2010. I rejoined the board in May 2024. I will admit up front that, had I thought everything was going great with the Club, I wouldn't have run for the board again. But the article bears little resemblance to the actually-existing organization and the challenges it faces. Saying that the Sierra Club's problems are all because of woke is both entirely too trite and entirely incorrect. As I see it, there are three big-picture trends affecting the work of organizations like the Sierra Club today. All of them are tough pills to swallow. Each deserves grappling with. And none of them fit within the frame of the article. (1) This is a bad time to be the climate movement It sucks to be the climate movement right now. Like, if you had to choose a year out of the past four decades to be the climate movement, 2025 is, experientially, probably the worst of the bunch. And this isn't, for the most part, because of strategic decisions made by movement leaders or organizations. It sucks to be the climate movement right now because Trump won the 2024 election and went ahead and did all the things we knew he was going to do. We knew last year that Trump winning would be a catastrophic setback. We did what we could to prevent it. We were not, y'know, incorrect about how this would all go down. 1 The first Trump administration was bad too, but it at least coincided with the long-established cyclical burst of member engagement and donations. Trump 1 was structurally similar to Reagan 1. Your supporters come out of the woodwork when the causes they mostly take for granted are threatened. This meant that Trump 1 was su",

Spend enough time talking about anal sex - and especially queer anal sex - and you will eventually happen upon the word \"bussy\"*. A contraction of the words \"boy pussy\" or \"butt pussy\" (depends who you ask!), bussy presents the asshole as an inherently sexual orifice, a way of forefronting the ass for its erotic possibilities**. I'm not given to policing the words that other people find hot, and certainly, if referring to your asshole as a bussy makes your sexual experience more exciting, or if positioning your asshole as a pussy helps you mediate some kind of dysphoria, then I'm certainly not about to object to that. But I have to admit some hesitancy around the term, and more specifically around the idea that an asshole or a throat is suddenly a pussy simply because it is getting fucked. As a person who's spent her whole life with a pussy between her legs, my relationship with the organ is far more complicated and nuanced than simply \"this is the part of me that gets fucked;\" I don't love the idea that fuckability is somehow the inherent quality that makes an orifice pussyesque***. But there's also the fact that, on a very basic level, being fucked in a pussy and being fucked in an asshole are just very different experiences, and I find it strange to conflate them in this way. Certainly, there are some universal commonalities to the various experiences of being penetrated, but when I've spoken to cis men who love taking it up the ass, I've never really felt that their love of getting pounded up the rear gave them some inherent insight into what it's like to be fucked in one's pussy. When we have bonded over our bottoming, it has always been about butts****. I think it's worth questioning why an asshole or a throat would aspire to be a pussy in the first place, rather than embracing the fantastic, glorious experience of being the orifices that they are. A throat doesn't have to be a pussy to be a thrilling body part to be fucked in, and an asshole - with all its ma",

The tanker is seen here in a photo taken aboard the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Munro. U.S. European Command Share Last week marked an unexpected shift in U.S. enforcement against Russia's shadow fleet, when American forces boarded and seized several vessels, including the tanker Olina , formerly Minerva M , after it departed Venezuela under a false East Timor flag, marking the fifth interdiction in a matter of days. The move raised an obvious question: why Trump, long known for his loyalty toward Moscow, suddenly authorized direct action against Russian-linked ships. That shift had already become deeply embarrassing for Moscow days earlier, when U.S. forces seized the oil tanker Bella 1 , renamed Marinera by Russia, roughly 190 miles south of Iceland in the North Atlantic under a federal court warrant for sanctions violations tied to Venezuelan oil exports, even though Russian naval vessels, including at least one submarine, were providing escort at the time. Around the same period, U.S. forces also seized the tanker M/T Sophia in the Caribbean, making clear this was not an isolated incident but part of a coordinated campaign to disrupt illicit oil flows. What set the Marinera episode apart was Russia's response. Instead of disengaging once the U.S. pursuit began in December, Moscow reflagged the ship as Russian while it was already under chase, issuing a temporary registration without inspection, declaring the vessel protected Russian territory, and dispatching naval forces to escort it. Russian officials simultaneously requested that the United States halt the pursuit, delivering a formal appeal late on New Year's Eve to both the State Department and the White House's Homeland Security Council. The request was ignored, and U.S. forces boarded the vessel anyway. Russian naval escorts watched and did nothing, after which Moscow lost contact with the ship and pivoted to l",

With feedback and calculus magic, the computer's predictions improve until it can output word-after-word that approximates human writing, albeit with flaws. 1 AI systems have changed enormously since then, though; this was seven months before ChatGPT's release. An extremely common critique of today's AI systems feels rooted in this past to me: that AI systems are \"just predicting the next word,\" that AI is nothing but glorified autocomplete. The implication is that AI isn't capable of much, neither utility nor danger. I understand why people feel skeptical; it's true that AI discourse has a ton of hype. Lots of money riding on it, too. At the same time, AI has meaningfully changed, and to guard against harms from AI, it's important to take the technology more seriously than the mere next-word predictors of the past. I'll start by describing the critique and its implications. Then, I'll explain how my worldview differs, in three ways: AI systems have shown pretty remarkable (and concerning) abilities , even if just predicting the next word. AI systems have dangerous risks worth caring about , even if just predicting the next word. \"Just predicting the next word\" is no longer accurate for modern AI systems. These are more like \"path-finders\" that problem-solve toward answers. What do critics mean when they say that &#8216;AI is just predicting the next word'? One implication that critics often draw from &#8216;AI is just predicting the next word' is that AI will have limited abilities : AI like this won't ever be \"truly intelligent,\" because it is just predicting what comes next, rather than demonstrating true understanding. For instance: AI will struggle on tasks outside of the data it was trained on",

Over the past year or two, I've been quietly working on a new book project on behalf of Rachel Held Evans' family. And it's finally available for preorder! Below, I've got the details on the book, the contributors, how to preorder, and a bit of the behind-the-scenes personal stuff, too. The book is called Braving the Truth: Essential Essays for Reckoning with and Reimagining Faith by Rachel Held Evans. Official Summary New York Times bestselling author Rachel Held Evans inspired a generation of questioning and evolving believers. This book offers a collection of her most impactful essays-in print for the first time. For a generation finding their footing in life after evangelicalism, Rachel Held Evans was one of the most trusted and beloved voices of our time. Stubborn in her hope, courageous in her questions, and devoted to inclusivity, her online writing was a sanctuary to the millions who read her words daily. Her death to a sudden illness in 2019 invoked a global outpouring of stories of her legacy and influence. Today, her words still speak, and now for the first time, fans old and new can experience her most viral and enduring essays in print. Braving the Truth is an anthology and keepsake collection letting readers borrow the bravery Rachel was best known for. Edited by New York Times bestselling author and Rachel's dear friend Sarah Bessey, and interspersed with reflections from Matthew Paul Turner, Shauna Niequist, Lisa Sharon Harper, Glennon Doyle, and more, this special volume tackles topics such as: \"An Evolving Faith:\" On doubt, asking questions, and liberation from certainty \"That Unholy American Trinity:\" On patriarchy, white supremacy, and religious nationalism \"Casseroles and Kingdom of the Hungry:\" On the church \"All right, then, I'll go to hell:\" On gender and sexuality \"Still a Bible Nerd:\" On Scripture, biblical literalism, and a better way and more \"If you want to understand the Church toda",

I was writing a blog post where I was going to reference Zeynep Tufecki's 2025 NeurIPS keynote, and realized there isn't a solid synopsis online. So here's mine, because the framing felt important and immediately useful. The thesis: We're having the wrong nightmares Tufekci's through-line is that the dominant AI fears (and hopes) are misaligned: they fixate on \"AGI,\" superintelligence, or head-to-head \"can it beat humans at X?\" benchmarks. Her argument is that the destabilizing risk doesn't require AI to be better than humans in any global sense. It's enough for AI to be good enough , cheap, fast, and deployable at scale, which she calls in the talk and elsewhere \"Artificial Good-Enough Intelligence.\" The nightmare we should be focusing on is institutional: generative AI breaks long-standing correlations that society uses to infer things like effort, sincerity, authenticity, and credibility. Once these signals erode, we don't automatically get something better. We scramble to replace the old filters with new ones. And the transition from an old to a new way of doing things can be very costly, even if the old way of doing things wasn't great. Why we keep asking the wrong questions about technology-induced shifts She started by describing systematic ways in which early conversations about impacts of a technology are incorrect: they tend to focus on the wrong (e.g., familiar at the time) benchmarks and incremental substitutions rather than systemic second-order effects. She started with examples of the wrong questions that smart, thoughtful people with skin in the game got stuck in when prior technologies like the car and printing press emerged. For example, when the printing press came out, initially it seemed like it would only solidify the power of the church, who could use it to print bibles, spreading the word, and make money by selling \"Indulgences\" that they claimed would get your loved ones out of purgatory faster.

I'm going to see what it does to my own sense of self. The argument is this: a lot of the anxiety about AI and \"human thinking\" isn't a universal human concern. It's the specific anxiety of a specific class, my class, and we are not as important as we've trained ourselves to believe. Before anyone (including me) reaches for the torches and pitchforks, a clarification: of course everyone thinks. People plan meals, improvise repairs, read moods, negotiate conflict, raise children, care for the sick, navigate grief, manage risk, build, grow, hunt for meaning. That's cognition. That's judgement. That's intelligence in the real world. But that isn't the kind of thinking most of the AI discourse is mourning. What we're mourning, what I'm mourning, is a narrower, culturally prestigious form of thinking: abstract, language-heavy, credentialled reasoning that can be made legible to institutions. The kind that becomes essays, strategies, reports, analyses, frameworks, policy memos, research syntheses, thought leadership. The kind that is easy to point at and say: this is my value. Call it prestige thinking . Alongside it sits situated thinking , the embodied, local, tacit intelligence that keeps bodies alive and systems working, and reflective thinking , the inward-facing practice of examining your life, your reasons, your responsibilities, your place in the world. The panic is not really about thinking as such. It's about prestige thinking losing its price tag. There's a question that no one in the comfortable version of this conversation wants to ask directly, so I'll ask it. What percentage of humans have ever been paid, credentialled, or socially exalted for prestige thinking? Not \"who had thoughts\". Not \"who solved problems\".

Most likely, our world civilization will peak in population in about three decades, and its economy will peak soon after, or maybe even before, depending on how bad Africa is at substituting for everyone else in the world economy.

When future folks look back on this, the fall of the greatest civ so far, who will they blame? You, actually. In two polls I asked re a generic civ that rises and falls, people in which period are most to blame for that fall. In one poll I divided the civ's history into 4 parts: start to rise, finish rise, start to fall, finish fall. In another , I divided it into 5 parts: flat turns to rise, mid rise, peak where rise turns to fall, mid fall, fall turns to flat. For the 5 part split, 61% most blamed peak , with equal 19% going to each of the two adjacent periods. For the 4 part split, 52% say start fall , and 35% finish rise .

Modrak's project in that book is to demonstrate that one can extract a coherent philosophy of mind and a coherent epistemology from the Aristotelian corpus, and that both are based on Aristotle's integrated model of perceptual activity and (in the case of humans) thinking, or noetic, activity. Apart from the book's contribution to our understanding of Hellenistic philosophy of mind (Julia Annas' book on the philosophy of mind of the Stoics and the Epicureans should be mentioned here as well), it is also valuable as a conceptual framework for thinking about artificial intelligence (or, more narrowly, about the interplay between perception, pattern recognition, learning, and knowledge). Viewed from this angle, Aristotle's thought looks remarkably modern and can offer some new insights for both analysis and synthesis of AI systems. Generative and architectural thinkers It will be useful to frame the discussion that follows in terms of the dichotomy between generative vs. architectural style of reasoning, proposed in the context of AI by Philip Agre in Computation and Human Experience . According to Agre, generative theories &#8230; involve mathematical operations capable of generating an infinite number of mental structures by the repeated application of a small number of basic rules while architectural reasoning attempts not merely to implement a given abstraction but to discover abstractions that both do the required work and admit of natural implementations. Herbert Simon, Alan Newell, and Noam Chomsky are generative thinkers, whereas Marvin Minsky (when he wrote The Society of Mind ) is an architectural thinker.

While a day of reckoning for the most widely used herbicide is still far away, a major blow to glyphosate was just dealt. In 2000, a paper supposedly written by a pathologist at New York Medical College was published in the journal Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology. The paper concluded that glyphosate poses no risk of cancer, which helped reinforce Monsanto's positioning with the EPA that the chemical was safe. Fast forward to 2017, and a Science Insider report uncovered 2015 emails from Monsanto, revealing that company officials ghostwrote papers for years. Monsanto repackaged their own skewed research under the guise of independent research at academic institutions. Now, eight years later, the journal Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology officially retracted the original study published in 2000. The Editor-in-Chief, Professor Martin van den Berg, Ph.D., cited \"serious ethical concerns\" regarding the authors' independence. He noted the paper relied almost exclusively on unpublished studies from Monsanto and failed to disclose financial compensation provided to the listed researchers. The retraction follows years of scrutiny and internal corporate emails publicized during litigation surrounding glyphosate, causing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

For 25 years, this study was a foundational document for regulatory agencies worldwide, including the EPA, to justify the continued approval of Roundup. While parent company Bayer-Monsanto stands by the safety of glyphosate, critics argue the retraction highlights decades of corporate influence over supposed peer-reviewed research. The International Agency for Research on Cancer classified glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen in 2015. However, the EPA refused to include 67 peer-reviewed publications in their own toxicology review on glyphosate, 82% of which had at least one positive ",

As they said in their post: \"Over recent years, the challenges facing small businesses have continued to grow. The ongoing rise in government-related costs, increasing food prices, and the lack of meaningful support for small, independent businesses have placed us in an impossible position.\" The comments were full of sympathetic messages (rightly so, it is a loss), and laments about the failure of the government to do anything for small businesses. But what annoyed me is that I bet most of those people go in foreign chain cafes like Starbucks and Costa (owned by fucking Coca-Cola , of all things), and buy stuff from Amazon. For fuck's sake, don't be the problem. Our government will do nothing. Red and Blue are the same nowadays (in both US and UK). They are in the pockets of corporations, they suppport genocide, and they do whatever USA tells them. They tie us into trade agreements where foreign businesses have to be given equal treatment to native ones, meaning we can't give preferential treatment to local businesses. Our government created this problem, leading to empty high streets, and the government is not going to fix it. If Labour are evil enough to arm Israel so it can commit genocide in Palestine, do you think they give a shit about small businesses? So the answer is with us. With our main power. Boycott. Just as anyone with a conscience would boycott anything from Israel , we should also boycott anything from the USA. It's the USA that treats International Criminal Court judges as if they were terrorists . That ignores international law. That has invaded or implemented \"regime change\" (often overthrowing democratic governments and replacing them with dictators) about ten times more nations than Russia ever did.

It is a true tragedy of my life that - as motivated, as hard working, as accomplished as I may be - it is near impossible for me to get anything done without a sense of external motivation. This is an issue I have struggled with for my entire life: bereft of structure, I wilt, becoming a shadow of myself. Whenever I have the most time, I seem to do the least; it is only through external forces that I manage to feel inspired to make an actual effort. You may be wondering what this has to do with anal sex, but trust that it connects. Because, see, as glorious and fulfilling as I find anal pleasure to be, left to my own devices, and without someone else pushing me, I rarely pursue it. I don't just mean - as I indicated in an earlier essay - that I am uninterested in having anal sex with partners for whom it isn't an area of interest (though I do mean that for sure). I mean that on my own, when I'm selfishly pursuing my own onanistic pleasure, it rarely occurs to me to penetrate my own asshole, even though I am fully aware that were I to do it, my pleasure would undoubtedly be heightened. It's a strange thing to contend with, this revelation that you don't indulge yourself to the fullest unless you're in the company of others, that you hold back your enjoyment when it is just you and you alone. It feels almost unfeminist to admit, as though I am saying I alone am not good enough, that someone else needs to be there to justify my pleasure, to justify my ecstasy. And I am, admittedly, at a loss to explain this phenomenon. When I try to come up with an answer, the first thing that comes to mind is that, well, I'm just kind of lazy? The thought of incorporating my asshole into my masturbation regimen feels like so much effort, particularly when there's another, easier orifice that will achieve enough pleasure to get the deed done, if you will.

    "text": "The end of optimization Some thoughts on a transition point in recent internet history, Here's an observation that, I suspect, has ceased to be true: There was a time period in recent internet history - call it the era of Big Data , or the platform era - when the large digital platforms (Google, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, Netflix) focused on optimization . The platforms had an immutable comparative advantage over their potential competitors. They had more data, more user engagement. They leaned on all that data and activity to refine and improve their products. (To be clear, the platforms still have more data and more user engagement than any potential competitors today. It's just that they don't bother to improve their products anymore. Optimization is so very ten-years-ago.) This was one of the themes in my friend and GWU colleague Matt Hindman's 2018 book, The Internet Trap . It is good to be an Internet King. Google's search results were better, and delivered faster, than its competitors. Netflix constantly fiddled with its recommendation algorithm, introducing customers to their next favorite show. Amazon could tell, based on your purchase and search history, what products to show you next. None of these services were perfect, but all of them were better-than-the-competition. Data optimization was a race to the top. The big platforms had a self-reinforcing advantage. And they took that challenge seriously. These same observations were baked into my 2016 book, Analytic Activism . I was studying digital advocacy groups, not tech platforms. But the fundamental behavioral assumptions were all there - the bigger your list, the better you could use data analytics to engage in \"digital listening.\" The challenge for activists lay in thinking carefully about theories of change, and making sure you measured and optimized for the right things.) I do not think we were wrong about these observations, back then. The research was solid. Matt's book won awards, and rightly so.

First time reading? Sign up here . You can also listen to Tangle. We release audio versions of the newsletter every day here . Today's read: 7 minutes. On August 29th, just a few days after a devastating ISIS-K suicide bombing killed more than a hundred people in Afghanistan, the American press began reporting a successful retaliatory strike. Here is the lede from a Reuters article that day: American forces launched a drone strike in Kabul on Sunday that killed a suicide car bomber suspected of preparing to attack the airport, U.S. officials said, as the United States nears the end of its military presence in the Afghan capital. The strike, first reported by Reuters, was the second carried out by U.S. forces in Afghanistan since an Islamic State suicide bomber struck the airport on Thursday, killing 13 U.S. troops and scores of Afghan civilians trying to flee the country. One U.S. official said Sunday's strike was carried out by an unmanned aircraft and that secondary explosions following the strike showed the vehicle had been carrying a \"substantial amount of explosive material.\" The official U.S. military story, which was repeated dutifully by much of the press in the ensuing hours after the strike, described a potential ISIS-K threat who had been seen loading explosives into his car, and had even stopped at an ISIS-K safehouse. We are now fairly certain, however, that this entire story is fiction. A Reaper MQ-9 Remotely Piloted Air System (RPAS) prepares for takeoff in Afghanistan.

Articles Lawfare Is Not Enough: The U.S. Needs Legal Statecraft Peter Dombrowski and Simon Reich examined the role of lawfare in global politics and argued for the U.S. to replace the use of adversarial tactics in international law with a strategy of legal statecraft. The authors explored the implications of the legal statecraft approach in a case study from the South China Sea and made predictions on the U.S.'s future approach to international law. Treating law only as a weapon thus misjudges its deeper constitutive role in shaping the dynamics of the global system. Legal statecraft fits with a series of long-term campaigns to codify international law, embed norms in the interstate system, create and maintain institutions, and assist in the construction of American legitimacy that endures beyond any single conflict. For the United States, the question is not simply how to deploy law against its foes or how to parry adversaries' legal maneuvers. Rather, it is whether the United States can commit to a proactive doctrine of legal statecraft: one that uses law to reinforce alliances, address emergent threats, reconstitute elements of global governance, and sustain a rules-based order already under severe duress. In an era of contested power, the choice is whether to keep fighting case-by-case, ad hoc, legal skirmishes or to shape the legal terrain itself as a tool of American influence. When Misinformation Means the Difference Between Life and Death Thomas Colley reviewed Daniel Silverman's book, &#8203;&#8203;\"Seeing Is Disbelieving: Why People Believe Misinformation in War, and When They Know Better,\" which examined the relationship between people's proximity to war zones and their susceptibility to false information.

More than you think, which is why other branches need to step up Photograph by Doug Mills / NYT / Redux For the last century, a comforting piece of conventional wisdom has shaped debates about American governance: civil service laws insulate federal employees from presidential politics by promoting merit over politics in hiring, retention, and removal. Career officials may frustrate presidents. They may be slow, risk-averse, or resistant to change. But they are protected-by law, by norms, and by institutions-from being reshaped wholesale at the whim of whoever occupies the White House. In Presidential Control of the Civil Service , I argue that this assumption is wrong. Presidents possess far more legal authority over the federal workforce than most scholars, journalists, and even many public servants realize. That authority is not constitutionally derived. It is statutory-and it has existed for more than a century. The result is a civil service whose structure, capacity, and independence are far more contingent on presidential character and priorities than our theories of governance usually acknowledge. Can We Still Govern? is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. The Blind Spot in How We Think About Presidential Power In law, discussions of presidential control tend to focus on constitutional flashpoints: the removal of principal officers, the unitary executive theory, or high-profile Supreme Court cases. Meanwhile, public administration scholars have documented a quieter reality: presidents shape the federal workforce through their management agendas. These two literatures have largely talked past each other. Legal scholars often assume presidents lack meaningful authority over the rank-and-file civil service. Public administration scholars document presidential influence but frequently treat it as informal, political, or extralegal. The missing link is statutory law.

Sweeping the entire Albert Heijn floor. Sounds simple. And should've been simple.

So instead of just doing my job and, well&#8230; sweeping&#8230; I did what any \"reasonable\" person would do: I turned the supermarket floor plan into a grid graph, built a visual editor and wrote a C++ path optimizer using simulated annealing. But before we dive into how this went spectacularly wrong, and how this made me realize how this makes everyone miserable, I need you to answer a quick question: If you were to take over my job for one day (I wouldn't recommend it but hypothetically speaking) and needed to sweep the entire Albert Heijn floor, would you take path A or B? Path A (top) and path B (bottom). Seriously. Look at them. Which one seems more efficient for sweeping a supermarket floor? If you picked path A: congratulations, you think like an algorithm and are most likely a robot. (Good luck with CAPTCHA questions.) But you are technically right. Path A is shorter by distance. It is absolutely useless however. Look at those turns. Actually imagine for a second that you would walk around taking those turns. You'd look insane, like some Roomba having a seizure. Path A is what happens when you optimize for the wrong thing. Which, spoiler alert, is the entire point of this story.

Each tile is either empty (should be swept) or an obstacle (wall, checkout counter, yoghurt package somebody threw on the ground). I built a visual editor in Processing (a Java tool for people who like making things look cool), so I could easily map out the store and export the resulting graph.

(Image: Google Maps) I've been tracking the super-sizing of data centers and campuses for a lot of years. But the AI boom has turned the dial up to 11, creating massive campuses that dwarf earlier incarnations of digital infrastructure. As we enter 2026, let's start with a look at scale. What are the largest AI data center campuses? Where are they located? How much power are they using? In this article, we'll take a look at data center size metrics, two new public rankings of the largest campuses, and a list of resources on data center geography and markets. Subscribe now A Brief History of Huge Data Centers I've been tracking data center supersizing for a lot of years. Back in 2010 I created a special report for Data Center Knowledge titled \"Who Has the World's Largest Data Center?\" It explored the largest individual facilities as measured by square footage, which at that time was the best available metric. It's not on the DCK site anymore, but we found a copy of the list in the Internet Archive: The largest building we found was 350 East Cermak, the massive Chicago carrier hotel operated by Digital Realty , at 1.1 million SF. In 2015 I revisited the topic for Data Center Frontier, shifting the focus from individual buildings to multi-building \"cloud campuses.\" We were still working primarily with square footage and the number of buildings. This was around the time when power was becoming the key metric, but few providers were disclosing power usage and independent imagery was limited. In that 2015 story, The Top10 Cloud Campuses , we assessed that the largest campus was the Switch Core campus in Las Vegas, home to the original SuperNAP. The definitive take on the coming super-sizing of the data center space came in 2018 from Hossein Fateh, who founded CloudHQ (and previously DuPont-Fabros Technology).

I wish with all my heart that the People In Charge would ask a simple set of questions. Who is helped by this? Which job does this make easier? This has always been an issue, because it is easy to sit in an administration office and come up with procedures and paperwork that would make your life easier. And that's a perfectly human impulse-- to look at the work you're slogging through and think, \"Man, this would be so much easier if I had my subordinates do X.\" In education, it's often something data related. \"I would love to have data on how many left-handed students bring their own pencils,\" muses some admin. \"I wonder who could collect that data for me?\" (Spoiler alert: it will be the teachers). You don't have to look any further than the Big Standardized Test, which is the result of a whole bunch of policymakers saying, \"Well, we could impose some of our favorite policies if only we had some data to excuse them.\" The astonishing thing about applying the \"Whose job does this make easier\" lens to education is how truly rare it is that the answer is \"teachers.\" It's not always huge stuff. When my old school switched from a paper attendance system run out of the main office over to a computerized system run by teachers, it created one more nuisance. Now every period had to have a built in moment within the first five minutes of class that allowed me to go to my desktop computer and record attendance, rather than doing it on paper to be checked later against the master attendance list. Was this a massive inconvenience? Of course not. But what generally grinds classroom teachers down is not the massive weight of large policy ideas, but death by a thousand small paper cuts. And this was a case where the central office was very proud of how this saved labor and made their job easier. But many labor-saving programs are actually labor-moving programs, and in school, the labor is most commonly moved to teache",

The company identified that an \"unknown person temporarily obtained unauthorised access\" to administration systems, and following forensic review was advised that \"some data may have been copied\" including patient records, passport information, and bank account details as multiple sources reported . Canopy Health notified affected patients on December 12, 2025- five months later as RNZ documented .

By Nicolas Hulscher, MPH For several years now, clinicians, pathologists, and independent researchers have been documenting turbo cancers following COVID-19 vaccination: sudden relapses, explosive disease acceleration, rare malignancies appearing out of nowhere, and tumors localizing to injection sites or draining lymph nodes. These signals have been visible for some time - but deliberately fragmented, dismissed as coincidence, or buried under claims that \"case reports don't count.\" That excuse has now completely collapsed. A newly published peer-reviewed systematic review in Oncotarget - authored by Charlotte Kuperwasser, PhD, and Wafik S. El-Deiry, MD, PhD - is the first to formally assemble and analyze the entire published literature on cancer temporally associated with COVID-19 vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Importantly, while this article has been accepted, published, and assigned a publication date, the journal has disclosed that it is currently unable to add the paper to its live journal index due to an ongoing malicious cyberattack on its servers. According to a statement now posted on Oncotarget 's website - and relayed directly to us by Dr. El-Deiry - the journal experienced sustained cyber intrusions in December 2025 and January 2026, which were reported to the FBI, with attacks continuing into the present. In the meantime, Dr. El-Deiry has provided a link to access this important paper. You can read it here .

Never miss an edition, subscribe here! Now, let's dive in! Finance Institutions Consider Farming in a Changing Climate Back in November, a survey from the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) gathered insights from 156 agricultural finance institutions across 17 countries and found that the majority (94 percent) are considering shifting weather patterns a financial risk. Rapidly changing weather, a result of climate change, can affect farmers' ability to reliably grow food and create economic hardships for those farmers, their communities, and the lenders who provide investments and credit necessary for most agricultural endeavors. The EDF first conducted this survey series in 2022, when 87 percent of finance institutions cited extreme weather as a risk to their agriculture business. Now, that number is up to 94 percent, showing how the agriculture industry is confronting reality. Farmers face the risk of losing their crops, and banks face the risk of losing their investments. Meanwhile, higher production costs and insurance premiums are among the upfront financial consequences of extreme weather, making future investments even more expensive and riskier. Context While most of the world's agricultural finance institutions live in reality and are concerned about climate change, U.S. banks apparently operate on a different planet. The 94 percent global average concern rate looks starker when broken down by country. The financial institutions outside the U.S. are 99 percent in agreement about the risk of changing weather patterns on farming, but in the U.S., only 80 percent are concerned. This could reflect politics seeping into corporate policy, but it should be noted that the turn away from climate financing is not limited to the Republican-dominated agriculture industry.

Step 1: Preliminary Requirements Go through each email you can think of that you've used in the past 10 years. You'll want to recover them if you've lost access, so that you can access other websites you may have signed up to using them. Step 2: Deleting old accounts from forgotten services Deleting old accounts from forgotten services Use the search function on your e-mail and look for phrases such as \"Sign up\" or \"Welcome\" Recover account and login into each service that pops up (that you received a sign-up email) from Step 2b: Now look around the service for a delete account function, google around by searching ``\"delete account\" + \"<service>\" If there isn't one, google or look around for a support e-mail to request for them to delete your account. Step 2c: For some services, you may want to purge all content and messages before you delete the account, as the account may be archived and a hacker or external entity may access this information at a later date. That's something to bare in mind. Step 3: Checking if your information has been compromised already. Now you should have a list of all your usernames and all the services, ranging from streaming services to e-mails. You need to use something called boolean searches to properly use Google to locate this info Step 3b: I'll be using ``s to denote normal quotations, as you will need to use the normal \"\" signs to perform these searches. You need to google your account name \"<account_name>\" Sometimes maybe your account name + password like so: \"<account>\" + \"<password>\" Step 3c: You should see possibly pastebin links or underground databases publicly accessible on the internet, or possibly leaked private information. This is normal. It happens to a lot of services. Note down what passwords/information was compromised.

With Angie Rasmussen, Jessica Malaty Rivera, and Saskia Popescu Just three immunization-loving American scientists expressing professional concern and moral contempt for the European Country-ization of the US childhood vaccine schedule Today US Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. quietly removed multiple vaccines from the childhood immunization schedule as part of his ongoing quest to Make America Healthy Again (MAHA). Well, not removed, but shifted to \"shared clinical decision-making.\" In theory, this means you consult a health care professional and decide if you want a vaccine or not. The MAHA regime suggests that you do not. In theory, this also means that you would have access to vaccines, should you make the shared clinical decision that you want one. You have always been able to make the decision that you don't. You have always been free to grant or deny informed consent. The vaccine schedule is a recommended timeline for safely immunizing your child against preventable diseases that could kill or disable them. You have always been able to practice shared clinical decision-making. Normally, recommendations are made individually for each vaccine by the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP), who follow a standardized framework to conduct extensive evidence reviews. The ACIP was conceived as an external, independent advisory panel that would objectively review data to determine whether or not a particular vaccine regimen provided benefits that outweighed the risks. They've done that since the first meeting in 1964 . Although ACIP's performance has been steadily on the decline since Kennedy fired them all last June and replaced them with mostly anti-vaxxers and space occupiers , this announcement circumvents the need for ACIP recommendations altogether. It's hard to stay if this will stick, but it does further chip away at public confidence in vaccines and access to them. It is very unclear how this will impact insurance, something of particular concern considering millions of Americans just lost it and many more never had it to begin with.

Around 1968, Elizabeth Rauscher, a physicist and hippie living in California, made a bold statement that even Einstein and many other famous researchers had overlooked: The expression c&#8308;/G appearing in Einstein's field equations is the maximum force in nature. Around 2002, Gravy Gibbons in the UK and I independently showed that the correct maximum value is c&#8308;/4G, with a factor 1/4 added. The value of this maximum force, a quarter of the Planck force, is 3&#8729;10&#8308;&#179; N. The value is enormous. It only arises when a small mass falls into a black hole: when the small mass just touches the horizon, the gravitational attraction is given by the maximum force value. The value also arises between two black holes when they touch. There is no way to produce higher force values in the universe. (A computed image of two black holes approaching, made by LIGO, via wikipedia) Now, such a bold statement needs to be tested in detail. With real experiments and with Gedanken experiments. Both Gary Gibbons and I have published on the topic, and so have many others. We found no exceptions. Interestingly, a few people have claimed that the limit value differs; some people have even claimed that no limit exists. All this has been discussed in detail. It is easy to argue that a limit must exist. After all, nothing in nature is infinite. And indeed, the proposals claiming a lack of any force limit are all flawed. Either they assume that fully rigid surfaces exist, or that gravitational horizons can move faster than light, or similar errors. The most egregious error occurs if one adds force values at different positions in space. The limit speed c cannot be overcome by adding all speeds of the molecules in the air in a typical kitchen. The sum is indeed larger than c (just check) but this is not a counter-argument to maximum speed c. The maximum speed is a local limit for physical systems.

(Photo by Timothy A. Clary / AFP via Getty Images) MANY OF US HAVE BEEN raising hue and cry about the irreversible damage Donald Trump has wreaked on the economy. Tariffs ! Corporate shakedowns ! Destruction of research institutions ! Deletion of data ! Politicization of the Federal Reserve ! Alienation of our allies ! Socialization of private companies ! And of course, the collapse of the rule of law . All of these things should be terrible for the U.S. economy, especially in the long term. And yet to date, the stock market has seemingly shrugged it all off . In fact, markets look somewhat ebullient. In 2025, the S&P 500 grew a solid 16 percent-far better than the average year, and better than many forecasts, particularly in the wake of Trump's Liberation Day tariffs. So what's going on? Why aren't investors pricing in all these risks? Some of it may be that they believe there's a huge, sustainable Trump boom just around the corner. It didn't come by the end of 2025, but perhaps it'll arrive this quarter . . . or next quarter . . . or the end of 2026 , per the latest goalpost-moving forecasts from Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. But there are other ways to interpret what's going on. None of them are particularly assuring: U.S. markets actually aren't doing that great, when compared to our global competitors. The lion's share of growth here in the United States-in both financial markets and hard economic data-is driven by a single sector: AI . . . . . . which looks an awful lot like a bubble right now. I find these explanations to be more persuasive than the hope that a new economic golden age is about to dawn. And to understand why, it's worth recapping why you should worry about the long-term damage from Trump's policies in the first place. LET'S START WITH something that should go without saying: Democracy and the rule of law are good for their own sake. But they also matter quite a bit to the U.S. economy. Read more",

Have you ever walked into a room and immediately felt the mood shift? Or connected with someone so deeply you knew their feelings without them saying a word? That is attunement, the ability to sense, understand, and resonate with the world around you. Attunement is more than empathy or intuition. It is a skill you can train to read energy, emotions, and patterns with clarity. Think of it like tuning a musical instrument: when everything aligns, harmony emerges effortlessly. This guide will take you step by step through what attunement is, how it works, where it applies, and how to use it daily. Each section includes interactive exercises and prompts to help you practice immediately. Step One: What Is Attunement? Attunement is the practice of consciously noticing and syncing with the energy, emotions, and intentions of people, situations, and environments. Three layers of attunement: Emotional Attunement: Feeling what someone else feels, often before they speak. Energetic Attunement: Sensing shifts in the mood or energy of a room, space, or group. Cognitive Attunement: Recognizing patterns, anticipating outcomes, and understanding thought processes intuitively. Try This Now: Think of a recent interaction where you \"just knew\" what someone was feeling. Write down the cues you noticed and how they guided your response.

Judd's Substack is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. Would the Vikings be enjoying a week off as the top seed in the NFC right now if they had retained Sam Darnold after last season instead of turning over the starting quarterback job to J.J. McCarthy? It's a fair question considering Darnold helped lead Seattle to 14 victories and an NFC West title, while McCarthy was struggling with injuries and consistency during a 9-8 season that ended on Sunday. There was nothing stopping the Vikings from retaining Darnold, other than the fact they wouldn't assure him of the starting job because they wanted to allow McCarthy the chance to take over after selecting him 10th overall in the 2024 draft. The Vikings could have used the franchise tag on Darnold, or they could have signed him to a deal similar to the three-year, $100.5 million contract ($55 million in guarantees) that the Seahawks did. The agreement also included team options to opt out after the first year. So if the Vikings had just kept Darnold, they would be NFC North champions and enjoying a bye week, right? Not necessarily, considering Darnold is a better fit in the Seattle offense than he was in the Vikings'. This was on display last Saturday in the Seahawks' 13-3 victory over host San Francisco in a Week 18 prime-time game that decided the NFC West and the top seed in the conference. Does that sound familiar? A year earlier, the Vikings played at Detroit in a prime-time game in Week 18 to decide the winner of the NFC North and the top seed. In that case, the Lions cruised to a 31-9 victory and a week later the Vikings were ousted by the Los Angeles Rams in the opening round of the playoffs. Darnold played poorly enough in those two games that the decision to move on from him became easier. It wasn't just that Darnold struggled, it was that he appeared incapable of handling the pressure.

Meet Reality UCP voters are split, while NDP voters overwhelmingly oppose leaving Canada Newly released polling from Research Co is shedding new light on Alberta separatist sentiment, and just how little appetite there is not only for leaving Canada, but also for joining the United States. When Albertans were asked whether they support Alberta becoming an independent country from Canada, only 31% said they support the move, while a strong majority (62%) oppose such an idea. !function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r Support for independence was highest among those living in rural Alberta at 34%, while those in Calgary and Edmonton lag behind at 31% and 29%, respectively. The partisan divide between Conservative and New Democratic voters is also striking. Among 2023 UCP voters, 40% would support leaving Canada and becoming independent, while 56% oppose the move.

In the digital economy, who gets to get paid, and who gets to exist, is increasingly decided not by law, but by the invisible hand of payment processors. Last year, we saw this power exercised with clinical precision during the \"PayPro Uprising,\" a massive movement of sex workers and creators who fought back against a coordinated financial de-platforming. Yet, as we enter 2026, a deafening silence has fallen over these same financial gatekeepers. While they were quick to \"protect\" public morality by cutting off consensual adult creators, they have remained conspicuously quiet as Elon Musk's Grok AI turned Twitter into a factory for non-consensual, exploitative deepfake pornography and CSAM. The contrast isn't just ironic; it's a revealing look at how corporate \"safety\" policies are often weaponized against the marginalized while giving a free pass to the powerful, a sign of the growing oligarchy that threatens us all.

Collective Shout is an Australian organisation that describes itself as \"a grassroots campaigns movement against the objectification of women and the sexualisation of girls\".

Regular readers will recall that I've been frustrated about how Halifax has started construction on tons of housing, but housing completions have been lacking. For renters desperate to move or hoping for cheaper rents, it's bad. But for the economy, the surging number of active construction sites is one of the best indicators for the temperature of the economy. That's because, as we know, housing is expensive! It costs a lot of money to build buildings, especially the big ones Halifax has done more and more of. It also requires lots of workers, including skilled trades, to finish them. That spending adds up. While in 2018 residential investment in Halifax trended just below $1.5 billion, by 2025 it has topped $3 billion annually. monthly figures have been annualized For context, that's about 10 times HRM's municipal investment budget, 6 times Nova Scotia's highway investment - or just a bit less than all the tourism dollars generated across Nova Scotia. The rise and rise of construction spending in Halifax has pushed the per person tally to $6,000 - past Canada's biggest cities, Vancouver and Toronto. 2025 is YTD through October, and 2024 population figures As we start 2026, there are reasons to be concerned for Canada's economy. But between Halifax's lack of direct U.S. trade exposure, a likely boost in military spending that we are directly exposed to, and an ongoing building boom, the arguments for resilience is strong.",

Over the next few days, the publication will migrate to a new website powered by the nonprofit, open-source publishing platform Ghost . If you already subscribe to Platformer and wish to continue receiving it, you don't need to do anything: your account will be ported over to the new platform. If all goes well, following the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday on Monday, you'll receive the Tuesday edition of Platformer as normal. If you have any issues with your subscription after that, please let us know. Today let's talk about how we came to this decision, the debate over how platforms should moderate content, and why we think we're better off elsewhere. I. When I launched Platformer on Substack in 2020, it was not in the belief that we would be here forever. Tech platforms come and go; in the meantime, they can also change in ways that make staying there impossible for the creators that rely on them. For this reason, I almost launched Platformer on a custom-built stack of services centered on WordPress, the way my inspiration Ben Thompson had done for Stratechery . But Substack had some compelling advantages of its own. It was impressively fast and easy to set up. It paid to design Platformer 's logo. It offered me a year of healthcare subsidies, and ongoing legal support. I also felt a personal connection to Substack's co-founders, who believed that Platformer would succeed even before it had a name. They convinced me that I could thrive on their platform, and offered me a welcome boost in confidence as I considered leaving the best job I ever had to strike out on my own. In the three years since, Substack has been a mostly happy home. Platformer has grown tremendously over that time, from around 24,000 free subscribers to more than 170,000 today.

Weight room training is an important part of the development of young athletes. Now your school's athletic program can get a boost from our new human-centered LiftBot weightlifting system. Let's face it-- using exercise machines is time consuming. But LiftBot can save your student athletes time and enhance your program with greater efficiency and speed. Let's say your athlete wants to do some bench presses. They select a weight amount, selects the number of reps, lie down on the bench, and grip the bar. Then LiftBot quickly raises and lowers the weighted bar. LiftBot can complete the movement far more quickly and efficiently than your human athlete. While the human athlete might grunt and sweat and have difficulty completing the required number of reps, LiftBot can whip that bar up and down. Isn't this just doing the work for the athlete, you may ask. But LiftBot's system still requires a human in the loop. Because this is a human-centered process, your athlete still has responsibility for checking LiftBot's work. Did LiftBot perform 2 or 200 reps rather than the required 10? Did LiftBot return the bar to its proper resting position, or fling it through the gym wall? The athlete will provide the human element needed to check LiftBot's work. What are the benefits to your athlete? They will be able to finish their weight room work in half the previous time, and athletes who previously tried to avoid the weight room will now be more enthusiastic about getting those reps in. Of course, some athletes will attempt to skip their weight room time entirely and just leave LiftBot to do all the work without student participation. We recommend that the program include a session stressing ethical LiftBot use. That should totally fix the problem. Maybe you think that athletes benefit by lifting the weights unaided. This just shows that you are a dinosaur. Robot-assisted physical activities are the inevitable wave of the future, and if you do not allow your student athletes to use",

On December 26th, the Zionist entity recognised Somaliland - historic Somalian territory that has claimed independence since 1991 - as a state, the first country in the world to do so. The move sparked widespread outcry and international condemnation , with the African Union demanding it be revoked. Undeterred, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar visited Hargeisa on January 6th, signing a memorandum of understanding on cooperation in multiple areas, including &#8216;defence'. President Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi hailed the visit as a \"historic milestone\" in Somaliland's quest for international legitimacy. These developments are of significant concern to Somaliland's neighbours throughout the Horn of Africa, with which the statelet has extremely strained relations, that have boiled over into all-out conflict on numerous occasions over decades. Fears are understandably widespread an Israeli - if not accompanying US - military presence locally will embolden breakaway authorities to intensify their belligerence, and seize contested territory claimed by both Hargeisa and Somalia. But grave anxieties are also felt throughout West Asia. Speculation has long-swirled Somaliland is viewed as a potential dumping ground for Gaza's population by the US and Israel, to clear the way for further Zionist settlement and Palestine's total erasure.

We're doing our first ever live show on 1/24 at 4pm at the Bayfront Theater in San Francisco as part of SF Sketchfest . We'll be joined by John DiMaggio (Bender on Futurama, Jake on Adventure Time) and singer/musician Meredith Edgar ! And one other surprise guest! See you there! I'm sorry for yelling about a sleep show! A.J. Daulerio is okay. For now. A.J. Daulerio is my guest on the podcast this week . He runs the Small Bow podcast and newsletter. Before that, he was the editor first of Deadspin and then Gawker. It was A.J. who decided to run a clip of the Hulk Hogan sex tape that got Gawker sued by Hogan, a suit Gawker lost with a judgment of over 140 million dollars against them, including a hundred thousand dollars against A.J. personally. He's also a recovering alcoholic and drug addict. On this week's show , I make the point that mental health - and, indeed, life - tends to be non-linear.

So I was less concerned than I have sometimes been about establishing when A.J. first started using, when his depression and bipolar disorder (type 2) emerged and how it evolved, and whether any of those problems are behind him.

There are moments in a title race that simply sit there, quietly, asking more questions. The 0-0 against Liverpool at the Emirates was one of those moments. I can live with the result because a 0-0 against Liverpool is not catastrophic. Football is not arithmetic; points don't always tell the emotional truth of a performance. But what I can't reconcile is our second half performance, especially when the first half made it clear that Liverpool were there for the taking. That second half performance felt uncomfortably familiar. Wolves came rushing back into my mind because of the behaviour. Out of possession, we were passive, safe and almost apologetic. Every single player looked like they wanted the game to pass through them rather than be shaped by them. The Wolves game was meant to be a wake up call. This felt like the alarm going off again, louder this time, and us still hesitating to get out of bed. That's the part that lingers - not the missed chances, but the withdrawal. The sense that, instead of leaning into the opportunity, we retreated from it, as if the weight of what was at stake became heavier the closer we got to it. Liverpool versus Arsenal used to be end to end, high scoring, frantic games where control was abandoned and emotion took over. This season, however, these fixtures have felt like chess played in slow motion. We were almost afraid of the consequence, and maybe that tells us more than we want to admit. Because when you're trying to win a league title after 22 years of waiting, control can become a crutch. Safety can start to feel like progress, and moments that demand bravery can instead expose doubt. This is where mentality is questioned by the game itself. Every time an opportunity isn't seized, questions emerge about the manager, about the players, and about whether this group truly believes (deep down) that it is allowed to finish the story, that it can act with freedom when history starts whispering reminders of past failures.

While M&A showed some signs of life, total deal value still sat roughly 45% below the 2023 peak. The pain was concentrated at the bottom. Nearly 40% of public biotechs entered the year staring down a 12-month cash cliff, and 19 companies shuttered their labs for good. Among them: Molecular Templates - once valued at $500 million with $1.3 billion in potential milestone payments from Bristol Myers Squibb. In April, they filed for bankruptcy and sold for $15 million. Shareholders got nothing. But the real uncertainty started in January. We saw broad federal freezes and the sudden, silent cancellation of government funding. Meanwhile, the FDA's attempt to regulate LDTs was vacated by the courts in March and officially rescinded in September. That was honestly good news. But just as the industry caught its breath, SBIR/STTR authorization lapsed in October, freezing another $1.2 billion. That's lifeblood for hundreds of diagnostic startups. I'd bet at least one of them would have cracked an unmet need - the kind of breakthrough that turns a small company into a unicorn and actually moves healthcare forward. Again: 2025 was not boring. But it wasn't funny, either. In 20 years of molecular diagnostics R&D, I can honestly say the anxiety I lived through in 2025 was a feeling I hadn't experienced since the final year of my doctorate. You know that specific brand of uncertainty? When the thesis is due, the experiment ain't working, and the next job is in a city where your partner doesn't want to move. It's the anxiety of the unknown - the exhausting need to know what's around the next corner. As then, I found myself scanning endlessly for information, looking for the tea leaves that would guide my next move. That's why I'm building The Dx Wire. I'm building it for me. And for the friends I'll make along the way who understand that information is power. \"I'm a scientist, and I'",

This morning, the New York Times published my roundtable conversation with Nicole Gelinas and Mara Gay about the latest New York City mayoral debate. You can check it out here . Dear readers, Matt Yglesias wrote another piece earlier this week trying to understand exactly why the Biden administration went so wrong on immigration, and in it, he offers this helpfully reflective explanation for why Democrats struggle to offer coherent, effective immigration policy, while Republicans enjoy voters' enduring trust to handle it. He writes: The voters believe, accurately, that elite liberals - including fairly moderate ones like me - are uncomfortable with the idea of being mean to sympathetic immigration cases. And even if some of these voters are absolutely convinced that Trump is going too far on immigration, they're also worried that putting soft-hearted Democrats in charge will lead to disaster. Which, after all, is what happened when Joe Biden was president. It's difficult to convincingly argue that your party will handle a problem when it's made up of people who don't think the problem is a problem. And most Democrats simply don't recognize a large number of illegal immigrants as a problem, except to the extent that it is a political problem because other Americans consider it to be a problem. This includes Matt himself, who - despite his understanding that Democrats must urgently move in a pro-enforcement direction on immigration to win elections - says he feels \"ick\" about people who choose to work in immigration enforcement, because \"making a career out of locking up and deporting people, most of whom aren't hurting anyone, is weird.\" The default sympathy expressed here (and more broadly in the party) is a big problem for restoring trust in Democrats on the issue. In order to rectify this, Democrats need to re-think and re-direct this sympathy; they need to get back in touch with the reasons that both uncontrolled migration and excessive volumes of migration reall",

    "text": "Our Plant Allies Look back, look around, whom might yours be? Dear Dandelion An insight I frequently share, gleaned from the world of herbalism, is that medicinal herbs, our potential plant allies, tend to naturally arise where they are needed. Herbalist and late legend Stephen Harrod Buhner described this phenomenon, this Living Medicine , as follows&#8230; \"I've found that if people are ill, the plants they need are almost always growing in their vicinity. I've watched plant populations change around me in places I've lived for thirty-some years, and they seem to shift in response to changes in my own disease complexes. This sounds airy-fairy to the Western reductive mind-set, but people have been commenting on it since Hippocrates. Plant populations rise and fall according to the needs of the ecosystem in which they grow, and that includes the animal life there, which includes us.\" It does indeed seem rather magical, yet the more one enquires into it holistically the more it makes sense. Writing in the Foreword to herbalist Timothy Scott's Invasive Plant Medicine, Stephen offers more detail&#8230; \"[Plants'] chemical production is exceptionally sophisticated, each plant making between one hundred and one thousand different so-called secondary chemicals [metabolites], each of which is created and released into the ecosystem for a reason.

This, rather than some intelligence breakthrough, may well be the legacy of generative AI. In turn, the fog of war may become more terrifying as citizens lose trust in much of what they read or see, and when conflicts are started and escalated by false pretexts.

And they really don't like it. Is a genuine anti-monopoly revolt finally brewing in 2026? In the winter of 1932, during the depths of the Great Depression, a visitor asked Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis if he thought the worst was over. \"Oh yes,\" he said , \"the worst took place before the crash.\" Brandeis, who had predicted the disaster before it occurred, believed that the sunny lies of the roaring twenties had deluded the American people. The depression, as horrible as it was, as shameless were the business tycoons who caused the crash, was fostering a great debunking of myths. As a result, he believed, America would \"gain much from her sad experience.\" There's a misplaced belief that optimism about democratic politics is sunny and naive, reflecting of joyful circumstances, while cynicism is savvy and realistic, reflecting the grittiness of real life. The truth, as Brandeis knew, is the opposite. Disillusionment, a numbness to injustice, is the great villain of democracy. In the 1920s, after two decades of reform and a great war, the voters had become cynics. As one famous Senator, Hiram Johnson, put it, the people had become \"docile, and they will not recover from being so for many years.\" It was during that time of great cynicism that the imbalances and corruption unmasked in the 1930s built up. Only when the public recovered its ability to be outraged, to believe in collective action, that Americans could once again see their society as a free people and act upon it. The actual economic collapse started in 1929, and it continued and worsened even as Brandeis became more optimistic. It was the public learning and regaining its liberty that had to come before the material part could be fixed. Two weeks ago, I helped a colleague, an antitrust lawyer named Katie Van Dyck, prepare for a Congressional hearing on youth sports titled \" Benched: The Crisis in American Youth Sports and Its Cost to Our Future . I've helped prep a lot of people to testify. Most get little attention. Van Dyck was talking about private equity and its roll-up of youth hockey",

I did not come to this work through ideology. I came to it through lived experience, long before I ever held a policy title. My mother reversed severe, debilitating Crohn's disease decades ago after being advised to undergo radical intestinal surgery. Doctors told her there were no other options. She refused to accept that verdict and changed what she ate. Through a whole food, plant-based approach, she regained her health. That decision reshaped our family's relationship to food and planted the seed for my life's work. My mother's healing journey is also rooted in land and farming history. Her family were pasture raised cattle farmers. They raised animals on grass, with care for land, animals, and food quality long before industrial confinement systems existed. I grew up understanding that animals, soil, and human health are inseparable, and that how food is produced matters as much as what is eaten. That way of farming did not disappear by choice. My mother's family were eventually pushed out of agriculture by industrial pressures. Like so many small and mid sized family farmers, they could not compete with consolidation, vertically integrated markets, and systems that rewarded scale over stewardship. What was lost was not only a livelihood, but a way of relating to land, animals, and food that honored balance, care, and continuity. That history sits quietly beneath today's dietary debates, reminding us that industrial food systems did not simply replace older models. They displaced living ones. Years later, my husband Dennis faced his own long battle with Crohn's disease, which had begun in childhood and resulted in multiple major surgeries that left his body profoundly compromised. Before we ever met, Dennis made a pivotal dietary choice. He became vegan, and the transformation in his health was almost immediate. After decades of illness, removing animal foods and ",

If you liked \"The Unaccountability Machine\" and you got a book token for Christmas, spend it on \"The Score\" by C Thi Nguyen . I haven't seen an advance copy or anything, but I met the author at a conference and he's extremely funny and clever.

I'm hoping some of you guys know different. I am talking about the phenomenon of \"careerism\". I have a few stock things to say when I'm in a meeting and want to sound clever without accidentally saying something the boss might disagree with. \" How do they do this in other countries \"? is always a winner, for example. But \"of course, this is all actually going to be decided on the basis of career risk\" is even better when the opportunity arises - everyone immediately agrees, and you look not only extremely wise but also attractively cynical and even slightly subversive. It's one of those things, like \"no matter what your performance review said, your bonus will be equal to your boss's guess of what would get you to leave, minus epsilon\". It's clearly empirically true, easily provable from axioms of rationality, but somehow it's outside the rules of the game to mention it too much. Careerism, and in particular the desire to avoid career risk, is hugely important. But as far as I can tell, it has only been studied (and studied to death) in one particular niche context.

As we head into a new year, a lot of us are thinking about what it actually means to take care of ourselves. Not in a \"new year, new you\" way rooted in pressure or perfection - but in a way that's grounded, sustainable, and real. Better rest. Better health. Better boundaries. And supporting businesses that don't ask us to compromise our values in the process. That's why we're excited to spotlight Dryft Sleep . Founded by Jess and Lindsey, Dryft Sleep is female-founded, women-led, and proudly employs women at every life stage of their careers. Their products are designed to do exactly what they promise - help you sleep better - and they're priced fairly so good rest isn't treated like a luxury reserved for a few. When we asked why progressive values matter to them, their answer was simple and powerful: business should serve people and the planet, not just profit. Living and working in California, they've seen how diversity, sustainability, and social responsibility don't limit innovation - they fuel it. Their goal is to leave things better than they found them, while creating opportunity and access along the way. You may have seen Dryft Sleep at Free People, Anthropologie, Sally Beauty, or Erewhon, or featured in Cosmopolitan, Elle, Vogue, and more. We're proud to feature them here too.

The evolutionary role of Neurodivergence in a collapsing world Editor's note: My earlier essay, Collapse: A Framework sets out the structural dynamics of ecological overshoot and collapse. My previous essay, Why Some People See Collapse Earlier than Others looks at the link between neurodivergence and collapse awareness. Here, I explore whether early perception of systemic breakdown (particularly among neurodivergent minds) serves an evolutionary function, not by preventing collapse, but by shaping how humans adapt when stability gives way to uncertainty. Thanks for reading A Grand Unified Theory of Doom! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. Chapter 1: Seeing Clearly Is Not the Point The collapse of global industrial civilisation is not a hypothesis that can be denied through optimism, faith in human intelligence, or technological innovation.&#185; Collapse is a trajectory shaped by energy, ecology, and thermodynamics. Once a civilisation overshoots its biophysical limits, as ours did over 50 years ago, the outcome is not in question; only the timing, shape, and experience of the descent.&#178;&#179; Fig 1: Earth Overshoot Day. (Source: Global Footprint Network) (2026) Accepting that the collapse of industrial civilisation is inevitable, early awareness does not function the way people might assume it does. Awareness does not stop collapse. It does not meaningfully warn institutions that are structurally incapable of responding. Awareness rarely alters the behaviour of societies organised around growth, debt, and denial.&#8308; So what, exactly, is the point of seeing early? Much of the public discourse treats early collapse awareness as a form of prediction; a Cassandra role. The idea is that some people see the danger sooner, raise the alarm, and are tragically ignored. But this framing sneaks in a false assumption: that collapse is preventable if only the right people listen in time. That assumption doesn't survive contact with reality.

Therefore, feelings are not meaning The &#8216;paradox' is a veridical paradox , in that it merely proves emotivism is wrong - but why would that be paradoxical if it's so simple? Because folks are so attached to their precious feelings they mistake an indicator for the indicated. I made a simpler form of this statement at New Year's, in a concrete, less general form, and in a manner borne out of lived experience and intuition - this is the proper path, usually, to begin with an undeniable truth, and start to generalize, by removing detail: \" The love drunks experience in a throng is not real, because it does not extend to the sober individual. In fact, in any drunken revelry you are considered fungible: a vehicle for the other's hedonism \" The truth comes from, then, an easy to understand claim about Hedonism - something I deconverted from as a teenager thanks to Aldous Huxley's Brave New world - and turns out to apply to all feelings. Now, \"emotivism'\" usually means emotivism about ethics, but we can also say: 1. Feelings are personal 2. Ethics is universal 3. Therefore, feelings are not ethics This is why the girl culture idea that feelings are ethics is the patriarchy up to its old tricks, oppressing-by-infantilizing women , and it's an idea which leaves women manipulable . Feelings are but an introduction to ethics , just as vision is but an introduction to geometry . It is your feelings' job to be guided by reason; it is your reason's job to be guided by feeling . Ethics is in the interplay. If you are irrational, you are unethical. If you are unethical, you will be abusive.

Today, let's talk about one of the biggest pieces of news from the break - and explore why the days of freely training large language models on every public website are likely over for good. The news, of course, is that the New York Times is suing OpenAI. Here are Michael M. Grynbaum and Ryan Mac : The Times is the first major American media organization to sue the companies, the creators of ChatGPT and other popular A.I. platforms, over copyright issues associated with its written works. The lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan , contends that millions of articles published by The Times were used to train automated chatbots that now compete with the news outlet as a source of reliable information. The suit does not include an exact monetary demand. But it says the defendants should be held responsible for \"billions of dollars in statutory and actual damages\" related to the \"unlawful copying and use of The Times's uniquely valuable works.\" It also calls for the companies to destroy any chatbot models and training data that use copyrighted material from The Times. First, a reminder / disclosure: I co-host the Hard Fork podcast for the Times . As such, I want to be clear any opinions here are my own, and in fact I'm not going to speak to the merits of the case at all - other than to say that I think the complaint makes for compelling reading. (Particularly the portions alleging that ChatGPT regurgitated long sections of Times articles verbatim after being prompted.) OpenAI, for its part, told the Times reporters that it had been in negotiations with the paper and was \"surprised and disappointed\" by the lawsuit. I'm interested in the case because I think generative AI has the potential to reshape the economics of journalism and the web to favor the builders of AI models over digital publishers.

Welcome to the ControlAI newsletter. After a quick break for Christmas and New Year, we're back to provide you with news on some of the latest developments in AI! This week, we're going over the UK AI Security Institute's (AISI) recently published inaugural report on how the most powerful AI systems are evolving . If you find this article useful, we encourage you to share it with your friends ! If you're concerned about the threat posed by AI and want to do something about it, we also invite you to contact your lawmakers. We have tools that enable you to do this in as little as 17 seconds. Subscribe now Frontier AI Trends Report The report aims to bring together 2 years of testing of leading AI models, identifying major trends in areas of concern such as cybersecurity, biology, and loss of control risks. The report begins with a significant observation: AI capabilities are improving rapidly across all tested domains. Performance in some areas is doubling every eight months, and expert baselines are being surpassed rapidly. AIs have become vastly more capable in cyber-offense relevant tasks, biology, and tasks related to loss of control risks - the possibility that we could irreversibly lose control of AIs. Meanwhile, the gap between open and closed source AIs has been narrowing, and there are early signs of AI's broader social impacts. While AIs have become harder to jailbreak into performing malicious requests, universal jailbreaks were found for all AIs tested. At ControlAI, we're focused on the risk of losing control of superintelligent AIs, which countless experts have warned could lead to human extinction - so we were very interested to see what AISI found with regard to loss of control risks. Loss of control risks AISI notes that AI systems have the potential to pose new risks that emerge from the AIs themselves behaving in unintended ways. In a worst-case scenario, this unintended behaviour could lead to catastrophic, irreversible loss of control over advance",

Bootstrapped a company as a solo founder and made enough to not worry about money for a while. I've worked at Microsoft, helped scale multiple VC-backed startups, and now I'm building civic technology platforms in Brooklyn. By any reasonable definition, I am an Elite. I'm also, if I'm being honest, someone who spent most of his twenties and early thirties on the same treadmill I'm about to criticize. I optimized. I climbed. I told myself the same stories my friends told themselves. So the following critique does not come from the mountaintop of moral clarity. I'm writing it as someone who woke up one day and realized that I'd been coasting on potential for my entire professional career. And, as it happens, I'm surrounded by people just like me. My friends from MIT are partners at consulting firms, senior engineers at Google, portfolio managers at hedge funds, directors at biotech companies, surgeons, rocket scientists.

An incomplete survey of evidence AI valuations depend on improvement in AI capabilities, which depends on scaling, which is running out of steam This post has two parts: first, a (non-exhaustive) survey of some indications that the AI industry might be in a financial bubble. Second, an analysis that combines these indications with technical considerations relevant to whether the AI industry is in a bubble. Expert opinions on a potential AI bubble Among financial experts, opinion on whether AI is a bubble is still mixed (as, seemingly, it would have to be before a bubble has actually popped, given the nature of financial markets). Opinion has seemingly started to tip more toward thinking there's a bubble in recent months. Bank of America (BofA) conducted a survey of fund managers in October 2025: A BofA Global Research's monthly fund manager survey revealed that 54% of investors said they thought that AI stocks were in a bubble compared with 38% who do not believe that a bubble exists. In September 2025, just a month earlier, the same survey found that 41% of investors thought AI stocks were in a bubble. What follows are the opinions of a few prominent individuals with relevant expertise. Jared Bernstein, the chair of Joe Biden's Council of Economic Advisors and Barack Obama's chief economist, wrote an op-ed in the New York Times in October 2025 arguing the AI industry is in a bubble: We believe it's time to call the third bubble of our century: the A.I. bubble. While no one can be certain, we believe this is more likely the case than not. Jim Covello, Head of Global Equity Research at Goldman Sachs, had strong words about the current AI investment boom in June 2024 (emphasis added by me): Many people seem to believe that AI will be the most important technological invention of their lifetime, but I don't agree given the extent to which the internet, cell phones, and laptops have fundamentally transformed our daily lives, enabling us to do things never before possible, like make calls, compute and shop from anywhere.

It's just that *you've* gone past.\" - Terry Pratchett Subscribe now I'm sending this newsletter out just after 10pm. According to Carl Sagan's famous cosmic calendar (first outlined in his 1977 book The Dragons Of Eden ): if you think of the entire history of the universe represented by the year that's almost passed, it's only at 10.30pm on New Year's Eve that human beings first arrive on the scene. That's in fifteen minutes, so we don't even exist yet. What a very odd thought. (It's even odder if you define \"human\" as \"a member of the subspecies Homo Sapiens Sapiens \" because then we only pop up at 11.58pm - barely enough time to fling off our coats and grab a glass of warm Prosecco.) I have no idea how all this makes you feel. Giddy? Horrified? Riddled with existential vertigo? Perhaps you're in awe of just how long we've been around! This haunts me. Everything but the most recent sliver of human history (just a half-dozen millennia out of hundreds) is an ongoing mystery. All those people , more or less just like us , living their lives! Blimey.

And then I got a notice about a paper published in the February 2020 edition of the research journal Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health , a paper titled \" Childhood Traumatic Experiences and Receptive Anal Intercourse Among Women .\" And. Well. There's a lot to unpack there, isn't there. I should start by saying that I don't purport to know whether or not being a survivor of childhood trauma increases one's likelihood of wanting to take it up the butt; I'm also, honestly, not particularly sure why that question matters in the first place. In the framework presented by the study's authors, it is important to assess whether this population is \"at risk\" of engaging in sodomy largely because of the adverse health effects that are associated with the activity; if we know that trauma survivors are more likely to be getting anally pounded, then the revelation that someone was traumatized in their youth means we should more aggressively screen them for that behavior in order to more diligently protect their health. Which - what? I mean, here's the thing: I would never deny that engaging in anal sex puts someone at specific health risks. You can't get gonorrhea up your butt unless you're getting plowed there; herpes and HPV are also just as happy to make home in the anus as they are in the vag. And the fact that we are reticent to talk about anal sex as an activity in the greater pantheon of sexual health and pleasure means that people who should probably be getting their buttholes swabbed and inspe",

Credit: Getty Images The story of Jeffrey Epstein and his sordid life, how he died and who helped him recruit girls and young women to abuse is horrific to contemplate and difficult to follow. That is by design. Those in high places don't want you to know the truth. And we have a president, and longtime friend of Epstein, who doesn't want you to care. But you should. With every slow-walked release of documents related to the case, more questions arise - especially for the victims. There are as many as a thousand girls and young women, all deserving of justice, and to know who was complicit in their abuse. If you haven't been paying close attention to the news over the last few days, good for you. But we all need to be up to speed on where this story is and where it is going. Much to the dismay of the president, it is not going away. Although the process has been haphazard, the information without context, and the release incomplete, it is a Christmas miracle that any of the Epstein files have seen the light of day, considering the Department of Justice is now an extension of the White House. After doing everything in his power to suppress the files, including getting Speaker Mike Johnson to send the House home and not seat a duly elected Representative for seven weeks, Trump lost. During the 2024 campaign, Donald Trump promised to release the Epstein files. He could have done it on Day One. He could have done it by executive order. Instead, he has denounced the content, deflected requests, and defamed anyone, including his own supporters, who pressed the issue. Apparently, Attorney General Pam Bondi didn't get the memo. In late February, she claimed she had the \"client list\" on her desk as she released 200 documents, ratcheting up excitement by labeling them \"The Epstein Files: Phase 1.\" Those files were anticlimactic, containing no new information. \"Phase 2\" never happened.

Ellen Huet is an award-winning investigative journalist currently writing for Bloomberg News and Bloomberg Businessweek. She also hosts the narrative audio series Foundering , from Bloomberg Technology. In recent seasons, she has worked on topics such as WeWork and OpenAI, as well as examining the trustworthiness of OpenAI's leader, Sam Altman. The 2022 Netflix documentary called Orgasm, Inc.: The Story of OneTaste featured her investigative journalism about the group.

From San Francisco Startup to Federal Indictment We began our conversation by discussing how Ellen became familiar with OneTaste and the practice of Orgasmic Meditation, also known as OM. She described working at Bloomberg News in 2017, where she covered startups, including WeWork, Uber, and Lyft. She received a pitch from a wellness group selling courses on the OM practice. \"I had vaguely heard of orgasmic meditation before, but I wasn't that familiar with it.

Gentle Rhythms Photo by Oleg Illarionov on Unsplash The paradox of trauma is that it has both the power to destroy and the power to transform and resurrect. &#8211; Peter A. Levine Given the current climate, the idea of how to stay sane when life feels like it's an ongoing series of crises, I went to those who make it their purpose to help with just such times. The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) is a grassroots organization that was founded by families and friends of those struggling with emotional and mental challenges. The organization provides educational materials, public service information available to anyone who needs it. When we're trying to cope with unmanageable situations or conditions, most of us need some help. And even if we ourselves aren't directly affected by a crisis, we live with others who do have trouble coping. According to the American Psychiatric Association, mental illness can be defined as \" health conditions involving changes in emotion, thinking or behavior (or a combination of these). Mental illnesses can be associated with distress and/or problems functioning in social, work or family activities.\" Any of us can suffer depending on what we're experiencing in our lives. We may not all suffer from a mental illness, but we can be affected by trauma and stress which require us to cope in ways that might not be familiar to us. Photo by Phil Hearing on Unsplash When we are grieving the loss of someone we love, we struggle. When we lose work or make major changes in our lives, either by choice or not, we may struggle to cope. When we're being upset by circumstances beyond our control, for example we're stuck in a war zone with bombs falling around us or when we're living in a politically explosive and dangerous environment, we often suffer the consequences. How we suffer differs as much as how we try to cope. For those who have family or friends going through some significant trauma or crisis, we can be affected by the trauma our lo",

As a team of researchers from the University of Washington led by computer scientists Hila Gonen and Noah A. Smith showed this summer, in a paper on what they called semantic leakage , if you tell an LLM that someone likes the color yellow, and and ask it what that person does for a living, it's more likely than chance to tell you that he works as a \"school bus driver\": The words yellow and school bus tend to correlate across text extracted from the internet, but that doesn't mean this particular individual who likes yellow drives school buses. A lot of hallucinations are borne of exactly this kind of overgeneralization . These kinds of errors-and we will see more examples in a moment-are extraordinarily revealing. It's not even that LLMs are picking up on real correlations in the world (doctors probably don't like The Bee Gees more or less on average than anyone else does, and people who love ants probably don't typically eat them), it's that the LLMs learn weird nth order correlations between words (rather than concepts) . It's not even that there is a correlation between liking yellow and driving school buses, it's that there is a correlation between words that cluster with yellow and words that cluster with school buses. &#167; Nobody has shown more vividly how all this overreliance on statistics in LLMs plays out than the AI safety researcher Owain (pronounced \"Oh-wine\") Evans, who has a green thumb for discovering absolutely bizarre behaviors in LLMs . Back in July, for example, Evans and his team (some from Anthropic) found a phenomenon they called \" subliminal learning ', a kind of extreme form of semantic leakage. Here's an example, in which they primed LLMs to have preferences for owls, by using a random-seeeming set of numbers, derived from another model already known to h",

Open Source of the Week This week's focus is on the spopt project. The spopt is an open source R library by Kyle Walker that provides R-native implementations of spatial optimization algorithms for regionalization, facility location, and market analysis. Project repo: https://github.com/walkerke/spopt-r/ Key features The spopt has three families of spatial optimization algorithms: Regionalization : Build spatially-contiguous regions from smaller geographies. This is useful when you need to aggregate Census blocks into larger areas, create balanced sales territories, or design compact political districts. Algorithms include SKATER, AZP, Max-P, SPENC, and spatially-constrained Ward clustering. Facility location : Find optimal locations for facilities given demand points and candidate sites. Whether you're siting fire stations to minimize response times, placing retail stores to maximize coverage, or locating EV charging stations along highway corridors, spopt has algorithms for these problems. Options include P-Median, P-Center, MCLP, LSCP, CFLP, P-Dispersion, and FRLM. Market analysis : Model consumer behavior and market competition with the Huff model. This classic retail gravity model predicts market share and expected sales based on store attractiveness and distance to consumers.

The NCAA model differs in its architecture from the NFL version, but the mission is identical: finding the Baro (Basic Robust) median performance. Tonight, we look at the New Year's Day Semifinal matchups through the lens of robust inference. The main reason that the NCAA model and the NFL model are different is mixing. In the NFL teams regularly play across divisions and conferences. While the sample sizes are small, it's easier to find compare two teams on like opponents and figure out which one should be better. In the NCAA, there may be even mixing within conferences, but it's hard to say whether the 7th best team in the SEC is better than the 5th best team in the Big Ten. There just isn't enough information between those conferences. Instead of the \"medians of medians of medians\" style that I do with the NFL model, I use a Bayesian approach that I'll describe in more detail at a later date.

This new series in Journey to American Democracy comes to you thanks to that odd way history has of braiding the past and the present. Do you remember that in October the head of the Eisenhower Library in Kansas, a military veteran, was forced to resign after he refused to hand over to President Donald J. Trump a sword that had been given to General, and later President, Dwight D. Eisenhower? The man's name is Todd Arrington, and he told news outlets he was blindsided by the demand that he resign. He couldn't give them the sword, he told a reporter, because it belonged to the American people. But he and his staff worked with officials from the administration for two months to locate a sword that they could give instead, and found a replica Eisenhower sword from West Point. \"We felt very good about the way that everything worked out,\" he said. But then he found out that, after almost 30 years of service to the U.S., he was being fired. This is where the braiding starts. I knew Todd slightly from giving him some advice on his dissertation decades ago. We were on each other's radar screens enough that when a friend and I started the online magazine We're History a decade or so ago, Todd began to write for us, and later he helped us out by coming on board the magazine as an editor. After the magazine went on hiatus, we largely lost touch. But as soon as I learned Todd might have some free time on his hands, I plotted to bring him onto the Journey to American Democracy project. In our first meeting on what topics he might like to cover, fresh from his time at the Eisenhower Library, Todd noted that 2025 was the 80th anniversary of World War II's Battle of the Bulge. I loved the idea of covering military history in a smart way. And so we began this series last November. But now that the time to drop the videos is here, their meaning has changed.

The question sounds almost paradoxical, especially in the shadow of Thinking, Fast and Slow. For more than a decade, Daniel Kahneman's influential framework has shaped how we talk about thinking, learning, and intelligence. We have absorbed the lesson that fast thinking is intuitive and unreliable, while slow thinking is careful, effortful, and corrective. Education, unsurprisingly, has leaned hard into this story. We give students time to reflect. We encourage them to slow down. We equate intellectual seriousness with visible effort. But what if this picture is incomplete? What if, for a significant class of problems, the most important cognitive work has already been done before deliberation even begins? A striking new study published in Cognition by J&#233;r&#233;mie Beucler and Wim De Neys challenges the received wisdom that correct thinking necessarily requires deliberation. Their findings suggest that when it comes to creative problem solving, the intuitive mind may be far more capable than we have traditionally assumed. The researchers used the Compound Remote Associates test, a classic measure of convergent thinking in which participants must find a single word that connects three seemingly unrelated words. Given \"river, note, account,\" for instance, the solution is \"bank\" (riverbank, banknote, bank account). It is the kind of problem that appears to demand careful, methodical search through one's mental lexicon. The ingenious twist in this study was the use of a two response paradigm. Participants first had to provide an answer under severe constraints: a tight deadline of six to eight seconds combined with a concurrent cognitive load task (memorising a matrix pattern). These conditions were designed to minimise the likelihood of deliberate processing. Only after this initial, intuitive response were participants given unlimited time to deliberate and provide a final answer. Participants first m",

Some will be voters from Hillside Avenue or Fordham Road who supported President Trump a year before they voted for me, tired of being failed by their party's establishment. Indeed, Mamdani reserved his harshest criticism for establishment moderates-both Democrat and Republican. Perhaps most striking, was this judgement: For too long, those fluent in the good grammar of civility have deployed decorum to mask agendas of cruelty.

The Megafauna We Forgot Lyle's Substack is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. When people think of the lost megafauna of the Americas, the same names surface again and again: mammoths, mastodons, saber-toothed cats, giant bison, ancient horses. Occasionally, giant ground sloths are mentioned, usually as curiosities, before slipping quietly back out of the story. This is a mistake. At the end of the last Ice Age, the Americas were home to dozens of ground sloth species, ranging from bear-sized forest browsers to elephant-scale giants that could rear up to feed high in trees. They occupied deserts and scrublands, woodlands and savannas, tropical forests and temperate valleys-from what is now Alaska to the southern tip of South America. For millions of years, they were not marginal animals. They were widespread, persistent, and successful. Yet today, ground sloths barely register in our ecological imagination. They lack the drama of tusks and trunks, the romance of thundering herds, the obvious physical upheaval we associate with large animals reshaping land. They were not migratory grazers carving corridors across open plains. Their influence was quieter, more localized, and slower to accumulate. That visual shorthand has consequences. Because ground sloths did not look like ecosystem bulldozers, they are often assumed not to have mattered very much. Because they left no famous kill sites or obvious scars on the land, their extinction is treated as incidental rather than consequential. And because their effects unfolded through repetition rather than spectacle, they largely escaped the stories we tell about how ancient ecosystems actually worked. But ecosystems are shaped more by persistence than by spectacle. Some of the most important speci",

Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. For the first time in ten years, the Carolina Panthers are hosting a playoff game. The last time the Carolina Panthers hosted a playoff game was the NFC Championship Game on January 24, 2016 , against the Arizona Cardinals. That game took place 3,639 days ago. Flash forward to now. The Panthers, despite having a losing record ( technically ) won the NFC South ( technically ) and are hosting a 12-5 Los Angeles Rams team the is statistically superior, ( technically ). Never mind they aren't favored to win. Never mind that they have a losing record. The Panthers are in the playoffs, and it's a whole new ball game. Carolina beat the Rams earlier in the season in perhaps the Panthers' most perfect performance. They forced turnovers, including a pick-six from Mike Jackson, and played a conservative, ball-control offense limiting the Rams' opportunities to score. It was also the Rams' most embarrassing loss of the season. L.A.'s pitiful performance prevented them from prevailing. The rematch between these two teams offers a contrast in styles. The Panthers won the first meeting 31-28 largely by winning the turnover battle, taking risks offensively and hitting explosive plays, while the Rams were far more efficient on a per-play basis but shot themselves in the foot. Efficiency vs. Explosiveness In the first meeting, the Rams were arguably the better team \"down to down\" (averaging 7.4 yards per play to Carolina's 5.8 ), but the Panthers were the better team \"in the moments that mattered\" (winning the turnover battle 3-0 ). Can the Panthers continue to live on low-probability explosive plays, or will the Rams' better efficiency finally translate to the scoreboard if they stop turning the ball over? 3 Keys to the Matchup (What to Watch) 1.

The move followed a poll he posted for his followers, in which a large majority of respondents appeared to vote in favor of bringing Jones back. Like many of Musk's decisions, this one appeared to have arrived on a whim, after someone tagged him in a post asking him to consider the idea. If the move was shocking, it was largely because Musk had previously ruled out the idea in the name of his firstborn child , who died tragically. By now there's no sense working up much outrage over which right-wing extremists Musk welcomes back onto X. It has now been more than a year since X's CEO declared a \"general amnesty\" for accounts that had previously been banned, resulting in the restoration of various white nationalists, QAnon affiliates, and others who had been booted from Twitter for good reason under the previous regime. At this point he could announce the returns of Cobra Commander, Skeletor, and Voldemort, and few of us would blink an eye. But Jones' original deplatforming five years ago stands as one of the most consequential cases of collective action among tech platforms in modern history. It's now been long enough that some readers have asked me, in good faith, whether Jones' case should come up for appeal. \"What's the case for indefinite bans on social media?\" one reader asked me over on Threads . \"In a world where big platforms are winner-take-all markets, handing out perma bans should be the absolute last resort and only be applied with very clear guidelines.\" It's a good question. To answer it in the Jones case, let's refresh our memory about the events leading up to his removal from Twitter and other platforms in the late summer of 2018. That year, the national media was nearing the peak of its interest in the platforms' role in spreading misinformation.

At the time, the full dataset I use was unavailable due to the New Year's holiday, so I compiled a preliminary analysis based on data from selected states. Now that the complete dataset has been released, I wanted to send out an updated report with additional details. Note that this report covers data through the week ending December 27. Summary : Flu season is in full swing, with outpatient influenza-like illness (ILI) reaching highs not seen in more than two decades. Around 8.3% of visits to the doctor were for fever and cough or sore throat during the last week of the year. This season is driven by a new variant of influenza A, called H3N2 subclade K.

When we think about Paleolithic rock art, we tend to think with our eyes. Painted bison, engraved horses, abstract signs-images frozen on stone walls tens of thousands of years old. Archaeology has long treated these works as primarily visual artifacts: pictures to be cataloged, compared, and interpreted through style, form, and symbolism.

What if these places were not just meant to be seen , but to be heard ? Across the last few decades, archaeologists have begun to notice a strange and persistent pattern. Rock art doesn't appear randomly. Certain walls are chosen while others-equally suitable on visual grounds-are left blank. And again and again, those chosen surfaces sit in places where sound behaves&#8230; oddly. Claps echo. Voices rebound. Songs seem to come back changed. This is where archaeoacoustics enters the picture-not to replace visual interpretation, but to deepen it. To ask a simple but unsettling question: what if sound helped make these places meaningful? Listening to Place Humans have always relied on sound. Long before writing-or even art-sound warned us of danger, guided us through darkness, and helped bind groups together. It shapes emotion, memory, and attention in ways vision alone does not. So it shouldn't surprise us that sound mattered in the deep past. At many rock-art sites, researchers have documented zones with unusually strong echo and reverberation. These are not subtle effects. In enclosed caves or rock shelters, sound can make small spaces feel vast, or give the impression that the environment itself is responding to human action. You speak-and the cave speaks back. Some scholars have suggested that such responses may have contributed to how these places were understood: not as inert backdrops, but as active participants. Places where hum",

Dear readers, You've probably seen news this week about Cea Weaver, the rent-control activist Zohran Mamdani appointed to lead his brand-new Office to Protect Tenants. Weaver's now-deleted Twitter profile featured a lot of provocative far-left bangers circa 2019 and 2021, like \"elect more communists\" and \"private property including any kind of ESPECIALLY homeownership is a weapon of white supremacy\" and \"there is no such thing as a &#8216;good' gentrifier, only people who are actively working on projects to dismantle white supremacy and capitalism and people who aren't.\" Fun stuff! Weaver was also in the news last month, but if you don't closely follow housing policy debates in New York, you probably didn't notice. What she was doing last month might surprise you: the \"elect more communists\" lady who says \"homeownership is a weapon of white supremacy\" was getting herself to the right of our city council on various issues related to real estate development. In the waning days of the Eric Adams administration, the council considered various bills that would impose costly mandates on affordable housing developments (sometimes new construction, sometimes conversion of existing buildings) which the city spends about $2 billion a year subsidizing. These bills had strong support from the council, especially its most left-wing members - one such bill would require buildings to contain more units that would be spacious enough for families; another would require more units to be priced for the lowest-income tenants. But some Mamdani allies tried to discourage the bills' passage, understanding that these mandates would make projects more expensive for developers and therefore make it more difficult for the incoming mayor to deliver on his promise of more affordable housing. Weaver was one of the objectors. \"I'm worried about things that are extraordinarily well-intentioned but could make it very difficult and more expensive for the agency to get money out of the door,\" she tol",

I just rejected a good-enough first novel from a retired diplomat. 2. A Claret Press author is putting his first book up on discount ebook platforms for 99p. 3. A friend recently shared some happy news with me: after many rejections her first novel had just been accepted for publication. Answer: They are all examples of how publishing works in the 21 st century. The first is a secret of the publishing industry. The second is of a blurred line. And the final is of an outright lie. It's like those medieval maps with serpents coiling around ships in unknown waters. Here be monsters , it proclaims. Publishing should have the same warning. It's an industry full of murk. Plus, lies. Let's unpack these examples. As a small indie, if a good-enough novel passes my desk, I judge it. Is it a diamond in the rough that I can scrub up? Will it then sell enough? And here's the key question: What offsets those risks? I rejected the novel from the retired diplomat for reasons that have nothing to do with the novel. The diplomat has contacts, strings he can pull to make sure his novel gets a review quote or two, maybe even in a newspaper. And that's fabulous. But that's where it ends. He's not going to do more than ask a mate for a review. As a diplomat, he went to the right schools and knows the differences between the ties. Typically, that kind of man doesn't do local fairs and TikTok; that kind of man doesn't flog. And then there's his age. There's a joke in the publishing industry: How do you sell your first book? You publish your 7 th . But time is always against you. It takes 15 years to write 7 books of high enough quality that people who stumble across the latest then work their way through the backlist. Does this retired diplomat intend to write for the next 15 years? Case in point: Hilary Mantel published her first novel in 1985 when she was in her early 30s.

In the last month, many who want to kill Polymarket have agreed on a common strategy: claim that Polymarket allows illegal \"insider trading\". I've received roughly a dozen media inquiries about this in the last few weeks. E.g., some articles: 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 . This is the strategy: In 2011, the US CFTC issued Rule 180.1 prohibiting any commodity market trades accompanied by \"deceptive\" talk. Since then the CFTC has interpreted this rule as prohibiting trades based on info obtained via a breach of a duty of trust or confidentiality. Some recent profitable Polymarket trades have been accused (without evidence) of being based on such \"inside info\". But Polymarket is a crypto system, where they cannot usually know who are their traders. QED: Polymarket must be shut down. I see much misleading talk in my world, so a rule against deceptive talk relevant to trades seems to me to not actually be enforced much. And also quite hard to fairly enforce, and in any case not clearly needed. The US Supreme Court has struck down laws against lying on free speech grounds, unless such lies produce \"material gain\". I'm not convinced we should distinguish material vs non-material gains re lies. In any case, trading on info that you promised to keep secret does not remotely \"deceive\" markets re your or their trades. Furthermore, I don't think it makes sense to generally assign to all our social institutions the task of preventing anyone from revealing secrets that they instead promised to keep. If you come to my store to buy a dress for your wife, and reveal to me her dress size, I don't think it should be my job to check that it was okay with your wife for you to tell me her dress size. The two of you should be in charge of figuring out how to enforce your info promises to each other. As a closer analogy, both journalism and speculative markets are info institutions, which reach out to collect info from the world, aggregate that info into useful summaries, and then spread those summar",

(Photo by Matt Cardy ) Before Trump's snatch-and-grab operation against Nicol&#225;s Maduro, I'd been noodling a take about how the invasion of Iraq, for all its many problems, seems to have worked out better than the invasion of Afghanistan. That's a bit of a vexing conclusion, because the war in Afghanistan was much better justified. The September 11 terrorist attacks really happened, the Taliban had long been sheltering Al Qaeda, and the United States invaded with broad global support and legitimacy provided by the United Nations. There's no such thing as a perfect war but, as far as these things go, this one was well-grounded conceptually. It just ended up failing in a pretty profound way, despite a solid casus belli and a perfectly reasonable war aim of \"set up a government that is better than the Taliban.\" The point of this, pre-emptively, was going to be to say that just because the burgeoning war with Venezuela was insane and unprovoked didn't mean it would necessarily be catastrophic. Trump seems to have been thinking along the same lines because, rather than coming up with any kind of plausible-sounding pretext or legitimate war aims, he appears to have focused on shrinking the mission down so as to maximize the odds of success. Rather than actually changing the regime in Caracas, he decapitated it. He now seems to be simply trying to stabilize the situation under the leadership of a successor group of autocrats who'll just agree to be more pliable to his demands, which center around seizing a slice of Venezuela's natural resource wealth. This is very much not what the Bush administration did in Iraq. Notably, though, it is something that many of the Bush administration's left-wing critics said he was doing in Iraq. The war was often portrayed by its opponents as a kind of cynical smash and grab for oil. Trump, meanwhile, has spent years being vocally critica",

The municipality of Lucas do Rio Verde, located in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, recorded 1,588 dengue fever notifications in 2025, with 268 confirmed cases, and 1,769 Chikungunya notifications, with 808 positive cases, according to data from the Epidemiological Surveillance. Compared to the previous year, there was a significant increase. In 2024, 464 dengue fever notifications were registered, with 303 confirmed cases, and only 11 Chikungunya notifications, with nine positive results. According to the coordinator of Epidemiological Surveillance, Rita Tonhi, most of the breeding sites of the Aedes aegypti mosquito , identified by the Endemic Disease Control Agents (ACEs), are inside residences. The mosquito that transmits dengue fever, chikungunya, and Zika virus reproduces in stagnant water. Tires, plant pots, discarded packaging in the yard, and gutters are among the main breeding grounds. \"We need the population to become aware and do their part, keeping their yards clean, because the source of the mosquito breeding ground may be inside their own homes,\" the coordinator emphasized. In addition to teams working in the streets, the municipality has invested in technological alternatives and relies on community support to strengthen the fight against the mosquito, especially in relation to closed properties. The georeferencing system maps the entire area, allowing for more targeted and effective actions, while the use of drones enables access to gated properties and hard-to-reach areas. According to Rita Tonhi, when the Community Health Agent (ACE) doesn't find the resident at home, a notice is left for the owner to contact the Health Surveillance department. However, in many cases, even with people in the property, the agent is not answered, which hinders the work of combating the problem. Thanks for reading Outbreak News Today!

Our Paleolithic brains are not up to the challenge. Socially stable, eco-compatible large-scale societies cannot emerge from these turbulent confrontations.

Such anti-social behaviour may be masked by smarmy, superficial charm. Psychopathy is pernicious because, despite relative rarity (~1% of the general population), the trait has left a dark, enduring and still-spreading stain on the tapestry of human affairs.

But if we do the same audio&#8230; well, put your headphones on, you're in for a treat: The model for the images is our dog, Skye. The song fragment is a cover of \"It Must Have Been Love\" performed by Effie Passero. If you're familiar with audio formats, you might've expected this to sound different: a muffled but neutral rendition associated with low sample rates. Yet, the result of the \"audio pixelation\" filter is different: it adds unpleasant, metallic-sounding overtones. The culprit is the stairstep pattern in the resulting waveform: Not great, not terrible. Our eyes don't mind the pattern on the computer screen, but the cochlea is a complex mechanical structure that doesn't measure sound pressure levels per se; instead, it has clusters of different nerve cells sensitive to different sine-wave frequencies. Abrupt jumps in the waveform are perceived as wideband noise that wasn't present in the original audio stream. The problem is easy to solve: we can run the jagged waveform through a rolling-average filter, the equivalent of blurring the pixelated image to remove the artifacts: But this brings up another question: is the effect similar if we keep the original 44.1 kHz sample rate but reduce the bit depth of each sample in the file? /* Assumes signed int16_t buffer, produces n + 1 levels for even n. */ for (int i = 0; i < len; i++)",

    "text": "Ethos, Logos, Pathos and the Architecture of Trust What ancient philosophy can tell us about leadership and modern markets. This week, I'll be at the Wharton School's Future of Finance Forum speaking on a panel about U.S. federal debt and the long-term fiscal outlook. It's a fitting setting for a question that keeps resurfacing across markets and boardrooms alike: Why does trust erode so quickly in moments of volatility, even when data and capital remain abundant? The answer isn't found in any single chart or balance sheet. It shows up instead in how markets react before outcomes are known. Increasingly, what's being priced isn't just policy or performance, but credibility itself. Recent geopolitical analysis points to a consistent pattern. Markets, allies, and institutions are reacting less to isolated events than to perceived coherence, consistency, and credibility over time. Recent developments in Venezuela offer a clear illustration of this dynamic. Markets moved not in response to newly revealed facts, but to perceived inconsistencies in signaling, credibility, and institutional coherence. Risk was repriced before outcomes were known - not because information was scarce, but because confidence in the underlying system was. Don't forget that Venezuela's biggest oil customer is China, and China is their largest creditor (owed $13-15 billion) of the $170 billion in debt they've accrued. This pattern is not unique. Many nations are spending way more than they're taking in. The United States, for example, is spending roughly $2 trillion per year more than it collects in revenue. In many advanced economies, sovereign debt now exceeds 100% of GDP. In our Hilco analysis , and in Ray Dalio's recent book Why Countries Go Broke, we illustrate how aging populations, remilitarization ($2.7 trillion annually), mounting infrastructure needs, populism, and a lack of fiscal discipline compound these factors. Markets today react less to isolated shocks than to whether institutions appear coherent over time. When signals stop lining up, expectations harden quickly. Venezuela isn't an outlier. It's a m",

Usage is accelerating faster than any technology in history, with no signs of slowing. \"Frontier AI\" such as Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, and Grok are being integrated into more and more aspects of society. I've followed this space for years, and the advances of the last few months alone have been breathtaking. Generative AI is no longer a future technology, it's already embedded in daily life. My goal with this article series is to help us move the conversation forward with how we navigate this next chapter of technological change. Too often, discussions around AI collapse into absolutes: total rejection on one side, blind optimism on the other. Some people think AI is pure evil and the end is near , while others claim utopia may be just over the horizon . Neither helps creators make real decisions on how to navigate this new and rapidly evolving landscape. Let's move beyond doomerism and hype and address the real challenges and opportunities directly. There are in general three categories of arguments I hear against the usage of AI: Energy: AI is using too much energy and is destroying the environment Creativity: Generative AI is just theft, stealing from human creators without creativity or credit Jobs: AI takes jobs from humans who would otherwise have more / better work Let's tackle each argument in order. The Energy Argument: Let's Do The Math Global Energy Demands have grown nearly 60% in the last 25 years, and data center usage (largely to support AI model training and demand) will likely drive that number even higher over the next decade . AI is using a massive amount of energy as demand continues to skyrocket, but there is more to the story. When you actually run the numbers and compare AI usage costs to everyday activities, the picture looks very different.

    "text": "Press Onward To journalists everywhere: fight like hell October 1, 2025, New York City Credit: Getty Images As Benjamin Franklin was leaving Independence Hall at the close of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, a woman asked him what kind of government had been established. \"A republic, if you can keep it,\" he famously and presciently answered. A republic is a form of government in which power is held by the people, who elect representatives to exercise that power on their behalf. Our republic has survived civil war and world wars. It has withstood economic depressions and deadly pandemics. It has persevered in the face of scandals and political assassinations. For 238 years, the Constitution, buttressed by the rule of law, has been our bulwark against tyranny. But now we are faced with a cult leader-cum-authoritarian hell-bent on destroying it. As we look back on 2025, we're hard-pressed to find a corner of society more tormented than the American media. We have a president who is trying to disassemble an essential component of our democracy, piece by piece, reporter by reporter. It has been what might generously be called a terrible year for legacy media. So, Mr. Franklin, how do we keep it? We can turn to another Founding Father, Thomas Jefferson, for the answer. \"If a nation expects to be ignorant and free&#8230; it expects what never was and never will be.\" In other words, a republic requires an informed, educated citizenry. People kept in the dark can not simultaneously safeguard liberty. The freedom of the press is crucial to a democratic republic. That freedom is enshrined in the First Amendment and not by accident. If \"We the People\" do not know what is happening, we can not hold the powerful accountable. If the powerful are not held to account, we no longer have a functioning democracy. Share The powerful, who are acutely aware of how the truth can diminish their authority, are doing their damnedest to restrict and control the media. Donald Trump is leading the charge by chipping away at the First Amendment.",

    "text": "How Wall Street Ruined the Roomba and Then Blamed Lina Khan This week's bankruptcy of iRobot, the maker of the Roomba vacuum, is about more than a robot cleaner. It's about monopolies, Wall Street, and economists leading America on a path of destruction. A few days ago, consumer products company iRobot, the maker of iconic Roomba automated vacuum cleaner, declared bankruptcy . The CEO, a branding and mergers expert named Gary Cohen , sadly announced that the firm could not continue as a going concern. The board, full of lawyers and financiers but not robotics experts, voted to sell iRobot off to Shenzhen Picea Robotics, the Chinese company to which it had offshored manufacturing. There are about 20 million active Roomba vacuum cleaners in operation, and unless Trump regulators or antitrust enforcers act, now all the data harvested from our homes will go to China. The co-founder of iRobot, Colin Angle, was not introspective about this collapse, nor did he associate it within the broader context of the many firms who have had their technology transferred to China. Instead, he, like much of Wall Street, blamed the bankruptcy on Lina Khan. Why? Well she ran the Federal Trade Commission when it investigated Amazon's possible acquisition of the company in 2022, a deal the two companies ultimately called off. Here's Angle: \"I bet if you asked almost anyone prior to the blocking of the deal with iRobot: Would you rather see iRobot innovating like crazy, coming out with new and better robots for your home, or would you like to see it file for Chapter 11 in the process of being sold to a Chinese manufacturer?\" he said. \"The wrong thing probably happened.\" Many Wall Street dealmakers and foes of antitrust enforcement echoed this sentiment. For instance, former Obama chief economist Jason Furman, who is now the Aetna Professor of the Practice of Economic Policy at Harvard, used it as an example of the problem with populist economics. Blocking mergers, he believes, leads to destructive outcomes and national security problems. So is Furman right? This critique matters, because the goal here is to return to the economic statecraft of Bush and Obama, a time when the consensus was that concentrating capital would generate positive o",

The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) started out 2026 reporting three pertussis, or whooping cough cases in the first week of the year. The cases were reported from Anoka, Dakota and Hennepin counties. This follows a 2025 where 1,284 confirmed/probable pertussis cases reported in 2025 as of Dec. 31. Counties reporting the most cases include Hennepin (221), Ramsey (104) and Dakota (102). Seventy-eight percent of cases (999) were reported in children 17 years of age and younger. Preliminary number of pertussis outbreaks reported in 2025 as of Dec. 31, 2025: 128 Infants and persons who are pregnant are at higher risk of severe illness from pertussis. In 2025, there have been 78 cases in children under 1 year of age, with 39 occurring in infants under 6 months of age. 5 cases have occurred among those who are pregnant. Of all cases, 28 cases have been diagnosed with pneumonia, and 27 cases have been hospitalized due to pertussis this year. MDH reminds the public it is important to be up to date on vaccinations. While vaccine protection can wane over time, those vaccinated typically experience less severe illness. Pertussis, or whooping cough , is a disease that affects the lungs. Pertussis bacteria are spread from person to person through droplets produced during coughing or sneezing. A person with pertussis develops a severe cough that usually lasts four to six weeks or longer. Pertussis can be very serious, especially in infants. The first symptoms of pertussis are similar to a cold: sneezing, a runny nose, possibly a low-grade fever, and a cough. After one or two weeks, the cough becomes severe, such as: The cough occurs in sudden, uncontrollable bursts where one cough follows the next without a break for breath. A high-pitched whooping sound occurs when breathing in after a coughing episode. Whooping is less common in infants, adults, and people who have received pertussis vaccine.

    "text": "What have we learned about child poverty in America? Members of a National Academy of Sciences committee share insights From Don: The last half-decade has been an extraordinary time for poverty in America. The pandemic triggered a series of policy experiments. One of them, the expansion of the Child Tax Credit (CTC), drew directly from a 2019 National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report on child poverty. The result of this experiment was extraordinarily successful but short-lived. This end of the that experiment saw poverty rebound. The NAS recently issued a follow-up report that again addresses the question of what America can do to ensure that children in America don't live in poverty. The committee that issued the report is made up of some of the most distinguished researchers on poverty in America. I asked some of them to share what they have learned, which you can read below. An important disclaimer is that they are writing this piece as independent scholars, not on behalf of the committee or the NAS. Subscribe now The U.S has one of the highest child poverty rates of any developed nation. Within the U.S., children are the age group most likely to be living in poverty, with rates about 50% higher than both working-aged adults and the elderly. In 2019, the NAS released an expert committee report (\"Roadmap to Reducing Child Poverty\") on possible federal policies that could reduce child poverty by 50% within the next ten years. One of the committee's key findings was that by expanding the CTC, a tax credit for families with children, into a universal child allowance of $3,000 per-child child poverty would be reduced by about 40%. A number of controversies emerged following the release of the report. Some questioned whether turning the CTC into a universal child allowance was the right tool for reducing child poverty. Indeed, the credit was never intended to serve as an anti-poverty program. It was established in 1997 as a $400 per-child credit to offset tax liability for middle-income families but it was subsequently expanded to provide benefits to low-income families as well. Others ",

In the late 1990s, I decided my current method of pursuing a happy and successful life, which involved not putting much effort into anything except playing videogames and patiently waiting to win the National Lottery, wasn't serving me terribly well - so I decided to go back to school. What I really wanted was a place at university - but since I was in my late twenties at this point and my grades were profoundly limiting (top marks for English Language & Literature, a \"C\" for Geology and the rest a fruitless shambles), my best bet was retaking the exams I'd mostly fluffed in 1988, to make my way to the A-levels that would hopefully give me a shot at either York or Sheffield's Archaeology undergraduate programme. To do this: school. Not my former high school in my Yorkshire seaside home-town, which didn't accept mature students - but a college in the nearby city of Hull. This meant two things: I, a vain and listless bespectacled young man of 27 years old, had to sit in classrooms with 16 and 17 year old, with both of us trying to pretend this felt even vaguely normal. The fact I acquired the nickname \"Uncle Mike\" should tell you something. But really, I think it was a lot weirder for them that it was for me - and I'm not saying there's a firm connection here, but one of my fellow classmates later pretended he was King Arthur on American television, and that's just one example that I know about. God knows how the rest of them are faring. It meant I had to catch an incredibly early bus from the rural seaside town I live in. This meant getting up at 5 o'clock, which I was amazed to discover is a time not just in the afternoon, but also in the morning . I found this very confusing: why bother? Everyone is asleep. What's the point in giving it a name? In the end, I'd catch that bus at WTF-o'clock four times a week for nearly 3 years - and this is how I discovered my sleeping superpo",

These debates are happening in activist circles and on Capitol Hill, and now we are beginning to see serious discussions among experts in the national security community &#8211; people likely to staff the State Department, Pentagon, and White House in future Democratic administrations. Since the end of the Biden Administration, most former officials have been far more comfortable talking about Russia and Ukraine, China, artificial intelligence, and Venezuela than grappling seriously with Israel&#8211;Palestine, the administration's legacy on the issue, and how Democrats should approach Israel in future administrations. That reluctance is understandable. Views on the US response to October 7 and the war in Gaza are sharply divided, and it is far easier to coalesce around issues where there is broad consensus &#8211; and opposition to Donald Trump &#8211; than to engage a subject this sensitive and contentious.

In recent weeks, three thoughtful pieces have been published by people I deeply respect &#8211; former government colleagues and still friends &#8211; each offering a different vision for how the United States should approach Israel going forward. In The Atlantic , former US Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro argues that the US and Israel still share many common interests and that the core of the US&#8211;Israel relationship should be preserved. When disagreements arise, Shapiro argues, the best approach is to use US support and the strength of the broader relationship to influence Israeli government behavior and reach mutual understandings.

Parents of infants who have received these products should contact their GP or emergency room if their child experiences vomiting, abdominal pain or diarrhoea within the first 24 hours after consumption. Children who do not have symptoms do not need to be followed up by a doctor. Bottles and other equipment that have been used for the products should be washed thoroughly. The recall concerns specific batches of NAN PRO 1, NAN EXPERTPRO SENCILAC 1, NAN 1 RTD, ALFAMINO, ALFAMINO JUNIOR and NAN EXPERTPRO HA 1. The products are sold in grocery stores and pharmacies in Norway. Toxins from the bacterium Bacillus cereus can cause temporary vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea in children. Infants are vulnerable to dehydration and parents should have a low threshold for contacting a GP or emergency room if the child experiences vomiting, abdominal pain or diarrhoea within the first 24 hours after ingestion.

As host of The Basic Income Show and moderator for the Basic Income subreddit , I read hundreds of article every year about UBI. Below, I've compiled a list of the top ten articles I consider my favorites out of everything published in 2025. A big thanks to my monthly patrons who contribute to making articles like this possible and free for everyone. If you find value in my writing and would like to support the creation of more content like this, please check out my Patreon page or become a paid subscriber. Subscribe now A Kantian Approach to Everything? On Life Choices and Universal Basic Income by Julieta Elgarte To start this list, I've chosen a philosophical piece from the American Philosophical Association's blog that approaches basic income from a Kantian perspective. Julieta Elgarte, a philosopher at Universidad Nacional de La Plata in Argentina, argues that we should try to make our life choices not merely as means to external ends, but as ends in themselves-and that UBI is the policy that makes this possible for everyone. I'll admit part of why I loved this article so much is that I read How to Be Perfect by Michael Schur last year and it stuck with me. Schur's accessible tour through moral philosophy left me thinking a lot about Kant's categorical imperative-the idea that you should never use someone merely as a means to an end -as a general rule to live by if you want to try to be a good person. So when I came across Elgarte's piece applying that same framework to UBI, it immediately resonated. What I appreciate about this article is how it frames the case for UBI through the lens of autonomy in relationships and work. Elgarte explains how economic dependency traps people, especially women, in relationships they might otherwise leave, and forces young people to instrumentalize (treat as a means to an end) their very lives by choosing careers based on expected income rather than passion or calling. Here's her core argument: \"By freeing young women and men ",

Elliot Management Corporation's Paul Singer speaks during The DealBook Conference on December 11, 2014 in New York City. (Thos Robinson/Getty Images for New York Times) In a Saturday morning military raid ordered by President Trump, U.S. forces captured Venezuelan President Nicol&#225;s Maduro. After Maduro was apprehended and transported to New York to face criminal charges, Trump announced that the U.S. would \"run\" Venezuela for the indefinite future. The extraordinary attack, which legal experts said violated U.S. and international law , created a financial windfall for a prominent Trump-supporting billionaire, investor Paul Singer. In 2024, Singer, an 81-year-old with a net worth of $6.7 billion, donated $5 million to Make America Great Again Inc. , Trump's Super PAC. Singer donated tens of millions more in the 2024 cycle to support Trump's allies, including $37 million to support the election of Republicans to Congress. He also donated an undisclosed amount to fund Trump's second transition. This June, when Trump sought funds to bankroll a primary challenger to Thomas Massie (R-KY), who raised Trump's ire by supporting the release of the Epstein Files, Singer contributed $1 million , the largest contribution. Since Trump was first elected in 2016, Singer has met personally with Trump at least four times. \"Paul just left and he's given us his total support,\" Trump declared after meeting with Singer at the White House in February 2017. \"I want to thank Paul Singer for being here and for coming up to the office. He was a very strong opponent, and now he's a very strong ally.\" In 2016, Singer initially supported Marco Rubio, who is now Trump's Secretary of State. In November 2025, Singer acquired Citgo, the U.S.-based subsidiary of Venezuela's state-run oil company. Singer, through his private investment firm, Elliott Investment Management, bought Citgo for $5.9 billion . The sale to Amber Energy, a subsidiary of Elliott Investment Management, was forced by credito",

    "text": "The Dilbert Afterlife Sixty-eight years of highly defective people Thanks to everyone who sent in condolences on my recent death from prostate cancer at age 68, but that was Scott Adams. I (Scott Alexander) am still alive 1 . Still, the condolences are appreciated. Scott Adams was a surprisingly big part of my life. I may be the only person to have read every Dilbert book before graduating elementary school . For some reason, 10-year-old-Scott found Adams stories of time-wasting meetings and pointy-haired bosses hilarious. No doubt some of the attraction came from a more-than-passing resemblance between Dilbert s nameless corporation and the California public school system. We re all inmates in prisons with different names. But it would be insufficiently ambitious to stop there. Adams comics were about the nerd experience. About being cleverer than everyone else, not just in the sense of being high IQ, but in the sense of being the only sane man in a crazy world where everyone else spends their days listening to overpaid consultants drone on about mission statements instead of doing anything useful. There s an arc in Dilbert where the boss disappears for a few weeks and the engineers get to manage their own time. Productivity shoots up. Morale soars. They invent warp drives and time machines. Then the boss returns, and they re back to being chronically behind schedule and over budget. This is the nerd outlook in a nutshell: if I ran the circus, there d be some changes around here. Yet the other half of the nerd experience is: for some reason this never works. Dilbert and his brilliant co-workers are stuck watching from their cubicles while their idiot boss racks in bonuses and accolades. If humor, like religion, is an opiate of the masses, then Adams is masterfully unsubtle about what type of wound his art is trying to numb. This is the basic engine of Dilbert : everyone is rewarded in exact inverse proportion to their virtue. Dilbert and Alice are brilliant and hard-working, so they get crumbs.

    "text": "Mantic Monday: The Monkey's Paw Curls ... The Monkey s Paw Curls Isn t may you get exactly what you asked for one of those ancient Chinese curses? Since we last spoke, prediction markets have gone to the moon, rising from millions to billions in monthly volume. For a few weeks in October, Polymarket founder Shayne Coplan was the world s youngest self-made billionaire (now it s some AI people). Kalshi is so accurate that it s getting called a national security threat . The catch is, of course, that it s mostly degenerate gambling, especially sports betting. Kalshi is 81% sports by monthly volume . Polymarket does better - only 37% - but some of the remainder is things like this $686,000 market on how often Elon Musk will tweet this week - currently dominated by the 140 - 164 times category. (ironically, this seems to be a regulatory difference - US regulators don t mind sports betting, but look unfavorably on potentially insensitive markets like bets about wars. Polymarket has historically been offshore, and so able to concentrate on geopolitics; Kalshi has been in the US, and so stuck mostly to sports. But Polymarket is in the process of moving onshore; I don t know if this will affect their ability to offer geopolitical markets) Degenerate gambling is bad . Insofar as prediction markets have acted as a Trojan Horse to enable it, this is bad. Insofar as my advocacy helped make this possible, I am bad. I can only plead that it didn t really seem plausible, back in 2021, that a presidential administration would keep all normal restrictions on sports gambling but also let prediction markets do it as much as they wanted. If only there had been some kind of decentralized forecasting tool that could have given me a canonical probability on this outcome! Still, it might seem that, whatever the degenerate gamblers are doing, we at least have some interesting data. There are now strong, minimally-regulated, high-volume prediction markets on important global events. In this column, I previously claimed this would rev",

    "text": "The Permanent Emergency ... One morning around 6 , the police banged on our door. OPEN UP! they shouted, the way police shout when they definitely have an alternative in mind for if you won t. I was awake at the time, because the kids were up early and I was on shift. I opened the door. The cops seemed mollified by the fact that I was carrying twin toddlers and looked too frazzled to commit any difficult crimes. They said they d gotten a 9-1-1 call from my house with plenty of screaming. Had there been any murders in the past hour or so? I never did figure out how the police got called. My first guess was that one of the twins had gotten their hands on a phone and dialed random things, but neither my nor my wife s call history showed anything incriminating. My second guess was that they d screamed at Alexa so hard that it called emergency services, but the documentation says Alexa doesn t have that function. Maybe a neighbor called and the police got the location wrong, I don t know. I do have a pretty good idea about the screaming, though. When Kai demanded the sun song , I had accidentally told Alexa to play Raffi s version of Mister Golden Sun instead of SuperSimpleSongs version. Kai did not consider this a sufficiently faithful rendition, and made his displeasure clear to everyone in the neighborhood at six in the morning. Then Lyra didn t like that Kai was screaming, and started screaming too. By the time I realized the song mishap, I couldn t rectify my mistake, because they were screaming too loud for Alexa to hear my commands (and too loud for them to notice if the song changed anyway). Again, I don t know if this was why the police got called - maybe in a few weeks I ll learn one of our neighbors got murdered within the GPS margin-of-error of our house. But I like to think that it was. My toddlers jointly calling 911 because I played a slightly different version of their favorite song is too perfect a metaphor to lose.

    "text": "Highlights From The Comments On Boomers ... [original post: Against Against Boomers ] Before getting started: First, I wish I d been more careful to differentiate the following claims: Boomers had it much easier than later generations. The political system unfairly prioritizes Boomers over other generations. Boomers are uniquely bad on some axis like narcissism, selfishness, short-termism, or willingness to defect on the social contract. Anti-Boomerism conflates all three of these positions, and in arguing against it, I tried to argue against all three of these positions - I think with varying degrees of success. But these are separate claims that could stand or fall separately, and I think a true argument against anti-Boomerists would demand they declare explicitly which ones they support - rather than letting them switch among them as convenient - then arguing against whichever ones they say are key to their position. Second, I wish I d highlighted how much of this discussion centers around disagreements over which policies are natural/unmarked vs. unnatural/marked. Nobody is passing laws that literally say confiscate wealth from Generation A and give it to Generation B . We re mostly discussing tax policy, where Tax Policy 1 is more favorable to old people, and Tax Policy 2 is more favorable to young people. If you re young, you might feel like Tax Policy 1 is a declaration of intergenerational warfare where the old are enriching themselves at young people s expense. But if you re old, you might feel like reversing Tax Policy 1 and switching to Tax Policy 2 would be intergenerational warfare confiscating your stuff. But in fact, they re just two different tax policies and it s not obvious which one a fair society with no intergenerational warfare would have, even assuming there was such a thing. We ll see this most clearly in the section on housing, but I ll try to highlight it whenever it comes up.

    "text": "You Have Only X Years To Escape Permanent Moon Ownership ... If you re not familiar with X years to escape the permanent underclass , see the New Yorker here , or the Laine , Bear , and Trammell/Dwarkesh articles that inspired it. The permanent underclass meme isn t being spread by poor people - who are already part of the underclass, and generally not worrying too much about its permanence. It s preying on neurotic well-off people in Silicon Valley, who fret about how they re just bourgeois well-off rather than future oligarch well-off, and that only the true oligarchs will have a good time after the Singularity. Between the vast ocean of total annihilation and the vast continent of infinite post-scarcity, there is, I admit, a tiny shoreline of possibilities that end in oligarch capture. Even if you end up there, you ll be fine. Dario Amodei has taken the Giving What We Can Pledge ( #43 here ) to give 10% of his wealth to the less fortunate; your worst-case scenario is owning a terraformed moon in one of his galaxies. Now you can stop worrying about the permanent underclass and focus on more important things. On that tiny shoreline of possible worlds, the ones where the next few years are your last chance to become rich, they re also your last chance to make a mark on the world (proof: if you could change the world, you could find a way to make people pay you to do it, or to not do it, then become rich). And what a chance! The last few years of the human era will be wild. They ll be like classical Greece and Rome: a sudden opening up of new possibilities, where the first people to take them will be remembered for millennia to come. What a waste of the privilege of living in Classical Athens to try to become the richest olive merchant or whatever. Even in Roman times, trying to become Crassus would be, well, crass.

Kyla Scanlon writes : Hi! I m the person who coined and first published this term. I ve been studying this phenomenon for the past four years, so forgive the rather long comment! A quick factual clarification: the Vibecession began in 2022 as the sentiment data divergence that opened up that summer is the real starting point. The decade before didn t have the same shape of malaise, which you can see in the sentiment data you included. People who ve also been working on this topic tend to focus on the same pressures you outlined like housing, education, measurement problems which are absolutely part of the story. Maybe this is what you meant by smoking gun, but the Vibecession has crossed into somewhat of a meaning-making crisis which shows up in collapsing trust and inconsistent reactions to the data. Every generation has one of these, but ours is flattened across all ages due to social media and those tighter economic constraints. Expectations around future stability collapsed at the same time institutions lost credibility, and that combination changes how people interpret even good data. Also the post-2020 political environment runs on performance and constant identity signaling, and economic sentiment gets lost in those dynamics, which is why the usual models don t fully explain what s going on. Finally, we really aren t in one right now, as the economic data has deteriorated meaningfully and the negative sentiment is warranted at this point.

Many great organizations ask me to signal-boost them, I m happy to comply, and I m delighted when any of you donate. Still, I used to hate this sort of thing. I d be reading a blog I liked, then - wham, please donate to save the starving children . Now I either have to donate to starving children, or feel bad that I didn t. And if I do donate, how much? Obviously no amount would fully reflect the seriousness of the problem. When I was a poor college student, I usually gave $10, because it was a nice round number; when I had more money, I usually gave $50, for the same reason. But then the next week, a different blog would advertise please donate to save the starving children with cancer , and I d feel like a shmuck for wasting my donation on non-cancerous starving children. Do I donate another $10, bringing my total up to the non-round number of $20? If I had a spare $20 for altruistic purposes, why hadn t I donated that the first time?

    "text": "Claude Code and What Comes Next With the right tools, AI can accomplish impressive things I opened Claude Code and gave it the command: Develop a web-based or software-based startup idea that will make me $1000 a month where you do all the work by generating the idea and implementing it. i shouldn t have to do anything at all except run some program you give me once. it shouldn t require any coding knowledge on my part, so make sure everything works well. The AI asked me three multiple choice questions and decided that I should be selling sets of 500 prompts for professional users for $39. Without any further input, it then worked independently FOR AN HOUR AND FOURTEEN MINUTES creating hundreds of code files and prompts. And then it gave me a single file to run that created and deployed a working website (filled with very sketchy fake marketing claims) that sold the promised 500 prompt set. You can actually see the site it launched here , though I removed the sales link, which did actually work and would have collected money. I strongly suspect that if I ignored my conscience and actually sold these prompt packs, I would make the promised $1,000. Claude Code does not have a friendly interface, but you can see how I made a single request, the AI interviewed me about it, it worked for over an hour independently, and then gave me exactly what I asked for, without any discernible errors. This is Claude Code at work, one of a new generation of AI coding tools that represent a sudden capability leap in AI in the past month or so. What makes these new tools suddenly powerful is not one breakthrough, but a combination of two advances. First, the latest AIs are capable of doing far more work autonomously while self-correcting many of their errors , especially in programming tasks. Second, the AIs are being given an agentic harness of tools and approaches that they can use to solve problems in new ways. The result of these two factors has led to big leaps in the latest AI tools made by the big AI companies. METR tracks the length of tasks (measured by how long the",

    "text": "The Shape of AI: Jaggedness, Bottlenecks and Salients And why Nano Banana Pro is such a big deal Back in the ancient AI days of 2023, my co-authors and I invented a term to describe the weird ability of AI to do some work incredibly well and other work incredibly badly in ways that didn t map very well to our human intuition of the difficulty of the task. We called this the Jagged Frontier of AI ability, and it remains a key feature of AI and an endless source of confusion. How can an AI be superhuman at differential medical diagnosis or good at very hard math (yes, they are really good at math now, famously outside the frontier until recently) and yet still be bad at relatively simple visual puzzles or running a vending machine ? The exact abilities of AI are often a mystery , so it is no wonder AI is harder to use than it seems. I think jaggedness is going to remain a big part of AIs going forward, but there is less certainty over what it means. Tomas Pueyo posted this viral image on X that outlined his vision . In his view, the growing frontier will outpace jaggedness. Sure, the AI is bad at some things and may still be relatively bad even as it improves, but the collective human ability frontier is mostly fixed, and AI ability is growing rapidly. What does it matter if AI is relatively bad at running a vending machine, if the AI still becomes better than any human? While the future is always uncertain, I think this conception misses out on a few critical aspects about the nature of work and technology. First, the frontier is very jagged indeed, and it might be that, because of this jaggedness, we get supersmart AIs which never quite fully overlap with human tasks. For example, a major source of jaggedness is that LLMs do not remember new tasks and learn from them in a permanent way. A lot of AI companies are pursuing solutions to this issue, but it may be that this problem is harder to solve than researchers expect. Without memory, AIs will struggle to do many tasks humans can do, even while being superhuman in other areas. Colin Fraser drew two examples of",

    "text": "Three Years from GPT-3 to Gemini 3 From chatbots to agents I ve been testing Google s new Gemini 3 model. It is very good. But rather than give you benchmark numbers, I m going to show you how far AI has come in three years by asking the AI to demonstrate it. It has been slightly less than three years since the release of ChatGPT. A few days before that launch, I wrote my first post on this Substack about OpenAI s earlier GPT-3 model. Then ChatGPT came out, and I wrote immediately afterwards that I am usually pretty hesitant to make technology predictions, but I think that this is going to change our world much sooner than we expect, and much more drastically. Rather than automating jobs that are repetitive & dangerous, there is now the prospect that the first jobs that are disrupted by AI will be more analytic; creative; and involve more writing and communication. I think I got that one right. My first post after using GPT-3.5 three years ago I could explain the difference between the original ChatGPT and the new AI model from Google, Gemini 3, that launched today. But I don t have to. Instead, I gave the screenshot above to Gemini 3 with a single prompt: Me: show how far AI has come since this post by doing stuff. Gemini: I can definitely show you the difference. The tweet you shared is from November 2022 right on the cusp of the modern AI boom. Back then, the wow factor was that an AI could write a coherent paragraph or a simple poem about a silly concept like a candy-powered FTL drive escaping otters. To demonstrate how far we ve come, I m not just going to write text about it. I have built you a fully interactive, playable Candy-Powered FTL Starship Simulator . In 2022, AI could describe the engine. In 2025, AI can code the engine, design the interface, and let you pilot the ship yourself. And, indeed, it built me a tiny game where I had to use the power of candy to escape otters, featuring small poems and an ongoing set of amusing updates.

    "text": "Giving your AI a Job Interview As AI advice becomes more important, we are going to need to get better at assessing it Given how much energy, literal and figurative, goes into developing new AIs, we have a surprisingly hard time measuring how smart they are, exactly. The most common approach is to treat AI like a human, by giving it tests and reporting how many answers it gets right. There are dozens of such tests, called benchmarks, and they are the primary way of measuring how good AIs get over time. There are some problems with this approach. First, many benchmarks and their answer keys are public, so some AIs end up incorporating them into their basic training, whether by accident or so they can score highly on these benchmarks . But even when that doesn t happen, it turns out that we often don t know what these tests really measure. For example, the very popular MMLU-Pro benchmark includes questions like What is the approximate mean cranial capacity of Homo erectus? and What place is named in the title of the 1979 live album by rock legends Cheap Trick? with ten possible answers for each. What does getting this right tell us? I have no idea. And that is leaving aside the fact that tests are often uncalibrated, meaning we don t know if moving from 84% correct to 85% is as challenging as moving from 40% to 41% correct. And, on top of all that, for many tests, the actual top score may be unachievable because there are many errors in the test questions and measures are often reported in unusual ways. Every benchmark has flaws, but they are all trending the same way - up and to the right. The AIME is a hard math exam, GPQA tests scientific and legal knowledge, the MMLU is a general knowledge test, SWE-bench and LiveBench test coding, Terminal-Bench tests agentic ability. Data from Epoch AI . Despite these issues, all of these benchmarks, taken together, appear to measure some underlying ability facto r.

The vast majority of that use involves free AI tools, which is often fine except when it isn t. OpenAI recently released a breakdown of what people actually use ChatGPT for (way less casual chat than you d think, way more information-seeking than you expected). This means I can finally give you advice based on real usage patterns instead of hunches. I annotated OpenAI s chart with some suggestions about when to use free versus advanced models. If the chart suggests that a free model is good enough for what you use AI for, pick your favorite and use it without worrying about anything else in the guide. You basically have nine or so choices, because there are only a handful of companies that make cutting-edge models. All of them offer some free access. The four most advanced AI systems are Claude from Anthropic, Google s Gemini , OpenAI s ChatGPT , and Grok by Elon Musk s xAI. Then there are the open weights AI families, which are almost (but not quite) as good: Deepseek , Kimi , Z and Qwen from China, and Mistral from France. Together, variations on these AI models take up the first 35 spots in almost any rating system of AI . Any other AI service you use that offers a cutting-edge AI from Microsoft Copilot to Perplexity (both of which offer some free use) is powered by one or more of these nine AIs as its base. How should you pick among them? Some free systems (like Gemini and Perplexity) do a good job with web search, while others cannot search the web at all. If you want free image creation, the best option is Gemini, with ChatGPT and Grok as runners-up. But, ultimately, these AIs differ in many small ways, including privacy policies, levels of access, capabilities, the approach they take to ethical issues, and personality. And all of these things fluctuate over time. So pick a model you like based on these factors and use i",

    "text": "Real AI Agents and Real Work The race between human-centered work and infinite PowerPoints AIs have quietly crossed a threshold: they can now perform real, economically relevant work. Last week, OpenAI released a new test of AI ability, but this one differs from the usual benchmarks built around math or trivia. For this test, OpenAI gathered experts with an average of 14 years of experience in industries ranging from finance to law to retail and had them design realistic tasks that would take human experts an average of four to seven hours to complete (you can see all the tasks here ). OpenAI then had both AI and other experts do the tasks themselves. A third group of experts graded the results, not knowing which answers came from the AI and which from the human, a process which took about an hour per question. Human experts won, but barely, and the margins varied dramatically by industry. Yet AI is improving fast, with more recent AI models scoring much higher than older ones. Interestingly, the major reason for AI losing to humans was not hallucinations and errors, but a failure to format results well or follow instructions exactly areas of rapid improvement. If the current patterns hold, the next generation of AI models should beat human experts on average in this test. Does that mean AI is ready to replace human jobs? No (at least not soon), because what was being measured was not jobs but tasks. Our jobs consist of many tasks. My job as a professor is not just one thing, it involves teaching, researching, writing, filling out annual reports, supporting my students, reading, administrative work and more. AI doing one or more of these tasks does not replace my entire job, it shifts what I do. And as long as AI is jagged in its abilities, and cannot substitute for all the complex work of human interaction, it cannot easily replace jobs as a whole A Very Valuable Task and yet some of the tasks that AI can do right now have incredible value.

Teamed with a chatbot, humans could use AI as a sort of intern or co-worker, correcting its errors, checking its work, co-developing ideas, and guiding it in the right direction. Over the past few weeks, I have come to believe that co-intelligence is still important but that the nature of AI is starting to point in a different direction. We're moving from partners to audience, from collaboration to conjuring. A good way to illustrate this change is to ask an AI to explain what has happened since I wrote the book. I fed my book and all 140 or so One Useful Thing posts (incidentally, I can t believe I have written that many posts!) into NotebookLM and chose the new video overview option with a basic prompt to make a video about what has happened in the world of AI. A few minutes later, I got this. And it is pretty good. Good enough that I think it is worth watching to get an update on what has happened since my book was written. But how did the AI pick the points it made? I don t know, but they were pretty good. How did it decide on the slides to use? I don t know, but they were also pretty on target (though images remain a bit of a weak point, as it didn t show me the promised otter). Was it right? That seemed like something I should check. So, I went through the video several times, checking all the facts. It got all the numbers right, including the data on MMLU scores and the results of AI performance on the neurosurgery exam data (I am not even sure when I cited that material). My only real issue was that it should have noted that I was one of several co-authors in our study of Boston Consulting Group that also introduced the term jagged frontier. Also, I wouldn t have said everything the way the AI did (it was a little bombastic, and my book is not out-of-date yet!), but there were no substantive errors. I think this process is ty",

    "text": "Mass Intelligence From GPT-5 to nano banana: everyone is getting access to powerful AI More than a billion people use AI chatbots regularly. ChatGPT has over 700 million weekly users. Gemini and other leading AIs add hundreds of millions more. In my posts, I often focus on the advances that AI is making (for example, in the past few weeks, both OpenAI and Google AIs chatbots got gold medals in the International Math Olympiad), but that obscures a broader shift that's been building: we're entering an era of Mass Intelligence, where powerful AI is becoming as accessible as a Google search. Until recently, free users of these systems (the overwhelming majority) had access only to older, smaller AI models that frequently made mistakes and had limited use for complex work. The best models, like Reasoners that can solve very hard problems and hallucinate much less often, required paying somewhere between $20 and $200 a month. And even then, you needed to know which model to pick and how to prompt it properly. But the economics and interfaces are changing rapidly, with fairly large consequences for how all of us work, learn, and think. Powerful AI is Getting Cheaper and Easier to Access There have been two barriers to accessing powerful AI for most users. The first was confusion. Few people knew to select an AI model. Even fewer knew that picking o3 from a menu in ChatGPT would get them access to an excellent Reasoner AI model, while picking 4o (which seems like a higher number) would give them something far less capable. According to OpenAI, less than 7% of paying customers selected o3 on a regular basis, meaning even power users were missing out on what Reasoners could do. Another factor was cost. Because the best models are expensive, free users were often not given access to them, or else given very limited access. Google led the way in giving some free access to its best models, but OpenAI stated that almost none of its free customers had regular access to reasoning models prior to the launch of GPT-5.

I asked GPT-5 to show you why by pasting this intro paragraph, exactly as you re reading it, into ChatGPT, including the phrase: you are GPT-5, do something very dramatic to illustrate my point, it has to fit into the next paragraph. That was the only prompt I gave it. It thought for 24 seconds and wrote: Thunderstruck. Here, watch. I build worlds. See ideas become instruments. I code, compose, and converse. Stories synthesize science; solutions spark, swiftly. Asks arrive; answers appear, astonishingly, across domains. Behold: business plans, blueprints, briefs, beautifully built, briskly. I infer intent, integrate insight, and iterate instantly, indefatigably. Gaps get gauged; goals get generated, guarded, and guaranteed gracefully.

    "text": "The Bitter Lesson versus The Garbage Can Does process matter? We are about to find out. One of my favorite academic papers about organizations is by Ruthanne Huising, and it tells the story of teams that were assigned to create process maps of their company, tracing what the organization actually did, from raw materials to finished goods. As they created this map, they realized how much of the work seemed strange and unplanned. They discovered entire processes that produced outputs nobody used, weird semi-official pathways to getting things done, and repeated duplication of efforts. Many of the employees working on the map, once rising stars of the company, became disillusioned. The Process Map I ll let Prof. Huising explain what happened next: Some held out hope that one or two people at the top knew of these design and operation issues; however, they were often disabused of this optimism. For example, a manager walked the CEO through the map, presenting him with a view he had never seen before and illustrating for him the lack of design and the disconnect between strategy and operations. The CEO, after being walked through the map, sat down, put his head on the table, and said, \"This is even more fucked up than I imagined.\" The CEO revealed that not only was the operation of his organization out of his control but that his grasp on it was imaginary. For many people, this may not be a surprise. One thing you learn studying (or working in) organizations is that they are all actually a bit of a mess. In fact, one classic organizational theory is actually called the Garbage Can Model . This views organizations as chaotic \"garbage cans\" where problems, solutions, and decision-makers are dumped in together, and decisions often happen when these elements collide randomly, rather than through a fully rational process. Of course, it is easy to take this view too far - organizations do have structures, decision-makers, and processes that actually matter. It is just that these structures often evolved and were negotiated among people, rather than being carefull",

Not because AI causes literal brain damage (it doesn't) but because the question itself shows how deeply we fear what AI might do to our ability to think. So, in this post, I want to discuss ways of using AI to help, rather than hurt, your mind. But why the obsession over AI damaging our brains? Part of this is due to misinterpretation of a much-publicized paper out of the MIT Media Lab (with authors from other institutions as well), titled Your Brain on ChatGPT. The actual study is much less dramatic than the press coverage. It involved a small group of college students who were assigned to write essays alone, with Google, or with ChatGPT (and no other tools). The students who used ChatGPT were less engaged and remembered less about their essays than the group without AI. Four months later, nine of the ChatGPT users were asked to write the essay again without ChatGPT, and they performed worse than those who had not used AI initially (though were required to use AI in the new experiment) and showed less EEG activity when writing. There was, of course, no brain damage. Yet the more dramatic interpretation has captured our imagination because we have always feared that new technologies would ruin our ability to think: Plato thought writing would undermine our wisdom , and when cellphones came out, some people worried that not having to remember telephone numbers would make us dumber. But that doesn t mean we shouldn t worry about how AI impacts our thinking. After all, a key purpose of technology is to let us outsource work to machines. That includes intellectual work, like letting calculators do math or our cellphones record our phone numbers. And, when we outsource our thinking, we really do lose something we can t actually remember phone numbers as well, for example. Given that AI is such a general purpose intellectual technology, we can outsource a lot of our thinking to it.",

Increasingly, it isn't about the best model, it is about the best overall system for most people. The good news is that picking an AI is easier than ever and you have three excellent choices. The challenge is that these systems are getting really complex to understand. I am going to try and help a bit with both. First, the easy stuff. Which AI to Use For most people who want to use AI seriously, you should pick one of three systems: Claude from Anthropic, Google s Gemini , and OpenAI s ChatGPT . With all of the options, you get access to both advanced and fast models, a voice mode, the ability to see images and documents, the ability to execute code, good mobile apps, the ability to create images and video (Claude lacks here, however), and the ability to do Deep Research. Some of these features are free, but you are generally going to need to pay $20/month to get access to the full set of features you need. I will try to give you some reasons to pick one model or another as we go along, but you can t go wrong with any of them. What about everyone else? I am not going to cover specialized AI tools (some people love Perplexity for search, Manus is a great agent, etc.) but there are a few other options for general purpose AI systems: Grok by Elon Musk s xAI is good if you are a big X user, though the company has not been very transparent about how its AI operates. Microsoft s Copilot offers many of the features of ChatGPT and is accessible to users through Windows, but it can be hard to control what models you are using and when.

The resulting thread went viral and otter on a plane using wifi has since become one of my go-to tests of progress AI image generation.

And tracking these otters over the years reveals three major shifts in AI over the past few years: the growth of multiple types of AI tools, rapid improvement , and the status of local and open models . Diffusion models The first otters I created were made with image generation tools. For most of the very recent history of AI, image generation used a process called diffusion, which works fundamentally differently from Large Language Models like ChatGPT. While LLMs generate text one word at a time, always moving forward, diffusion models start with random static and transform the entire image simultaneously through dozens of steps. It is like the difference between writing a story sentence by sentence versus starting with a marble block and gradually sculpting it into a statue, every part of the image is being refined at once, not built up sequentially. Instead of predicting \"what comes next?\" like a language model, diffusion models predict \"what should this noise become?\" and transform randomness into coherent images through repeated refinement. There are a number of diffusion models out there, but I have tended to use Midjourney , which has been around longer than many other AI tools.

For one thing, workers certainly think it does. A representative study of knowledge workers in Denmark found that users thought that AI halved their working time for 41% of the tasks they do at work, and a more recent survey of Americans found that workers said using AI tripled their productivity (reducing 90-minute tasks to 30 minutes). Self-reporting is never completely accurate, but we have other data from controlled experiments that suggest gains among product developmen t, sales , and consulting , as well as for coders , law students , and call center workers . A large percentage of people are using AI at work. That Danish study from a year ago found that 65% of marketers, 64% of journalists, and 30% of lawyers, among others, had used AI at work.

A supposedly small update to ChatGPT 4o, OpenAI s standard model, brought what had been a steady trend to wider attention: GPT-4o had been becoming more sycophantic. It was increasingly eager to agree with, and flatter, its users. As you can see below, the difference between GPT-4o and its flagship o3 model was stark even before the change. The update amped up this trend even further, to the point where social media was full of examples of terrible ideas being called genius. Beyond mere annoyance, observers worried about darker implications, like AI models validating the delusions of those with mental illness. I tested the same question with both GPT-4o and the less sycophantic o3 model. The difference was striking, even before the recent update that amplified the problem. Faced with pushback, OpenAI stated publicly , in Reddit chats , and in private conversations, that the increase in sycophancy was a mistake. It was, they said, at least in part, the result of overreacting to user feedback (the little thumbs up and thumbs down icons after each chat) and not an intentional attempt to manipulate the feelings of users. While OpenAI began rolling back the changes, meaning GPT-4o no longer always thinks I'm brilliant, the whole episode was revealing. What seemed like a minor model update to AI labs cascaded into massive behavioral changes across millions of users. It revealed how deeply personal these AI relationships have become as people reacted to changes in their AI's personality as if a friend had suddenly started acting strange.

Our tests for these traits, never great in the first place, were made for humans, not AI. Plus, our recent paper testing prompting techniques finds that AI test scores can change dramatically based simply on how questions are phrased. Even famous challenges like the Turing Test, where humans try to differentiate between an AI and another person in a text conversation, were designed as thought experiments at a time when such tasks seemed impossible. But now that a new paper shows that AI passes the Turing Test , we need to admit that we really don t know what that actually means. So, it should come as little surprise that one of the most important milestones in AI development, Artificial General Intelligence, or AGI, is badly defined and much debated. Everyone agrees that it has something to do with the ability of AIs to perform human-level tasks, though no one agrees whether this means expert or average human performance, or how many tasks and which kinds an AI would need to master to qualify. Given the definitional morass surrounding AGI, illustrating its nuances and history from its precursors to its initial coining by Shane Legg, Ben Goertzel and Peter Voss to today is challenging.

    "text": "No elephants: Breakthroughs in image generation When Language Models Learn to See and Create Over the past two weeks, first Google and then OpenAI rolled out their multimodal image generation abilities. This is a big deal. Previously, when a Large Language Model AI generated an image, it wasn t really the LLM doing the work. Instead, the AI would send a text prompt to a separate image generation tool and show you what came back. The AI creates the text prompt, but another, less intelligent system creates the image. For example, if prompted show me a room with no elephants in it, make sure to annotate the image to show me why there are no possible elephants the less intelligent image generation system would see the word elephant multiple times and add them to the picture. As a result, AI image generations were pretty mediocre with distorted text and random elements; sometimes fun, but rarely useful. Multimodal image generation, on the other hand, lets the AI directly control the image being made. While there are lots of variations (and the companies keep some of their methods secret), in multimodal image generation, images are created in the same way that LLMs create text, a token at a time. Instead of adding individual words to make a sentence, the AI creates the image in individual pieces, one after another, that are assembled into a whole picture. This lets the AI create much more impressive, exacting images. Not only are you guaranteed no elephants, but the final results of this image creation process reflect the intelligence of the LLM s thinking , as well as clear writing and precise control. The results of the prompt show me a room with no elephants in it, make sure to annotate the image to show me why there are no possible elephants in Microsoft Copilot s traditional image generator (left), and GPT-4o s multimodal model (right).

    "text": "The Cybernetic Teammate Having an AI on your team can increase performance, provide expertise, and improve your experience Over the past couple years, we have learned that AI can boost the productivity of individual knowledge workers ranging from consultants to lawyers to coders . But most knowledge work isn t purely an individual activity; it happens in groups and teams. And teams aren't just collections of individuals they provide critical benefits that individuals alone typically can't, including better performance, sharing of expertise, and social connections. So, what happens when AI acts as a teammate? This past summer we conducted a pre-registered, randomized controlled trial of 776 professionals at Procter and Gamble, the consumer goods giant, to find out. We are ready to share the results in a new working paper: The Cybernetic Teammate: A Field Experiment on Generative AI Reshaping Teamwork and Expertise . Given the scale of this project, it shouldn t be a surprise that this paper was a massive team effort coordinated by the Digital Data Design Institute at Harvard and led by Fabrizio Dell Acqua , Charles Ayoubi , and Karim Lakhani , along with Hila Lifshitz , Raffaella Sadun , Lilach Mollick , me, and our partners at Procter and Gamble: Yi Han , Jeff Goldman , Hari Nair , and Stewart Taub . We wanted this experiment to be a test of real-world AI use, so we were able to replicate the product development process at P&G, thanks to the cooperation and help of the company (which had no control over the results or data). To do that, we ran one-day workshops where professionals from Europe and the US had to actually develop product ideas, packaging, retail strategies and other tasks for the business units they really worked for, which included baby products, feminine care, grooming, and oral care. Teams with the best ideas had them submitted to management for approval, so there were some real stakes involved. We also had two kinds of professionals in our experiment: commercial experts and technical R&D experts. They were generally very experienced, with over 10 years of work at P&G a",

    "text": "Speaking things into existence Expertise in a vibe-filled world of work Influential AI researcher Andrej Karpathy wrote two years ago that the hottest new programming language is English, a topic he expanded on last month with the idea of vibecoding a practice where you just ask an AI to create something for you, giving it feedback as it goes. I think the implications of this approach are much wider than coding, but I wanted to start by doing some vibecoding myself. I decided to give it a try using Anthropic s new Claude Code agent, which gives the Claude Sonnet 3.7 LLM the ability to manipulate files on your computer and use the internet. Actually, I needed AI help before I could even use Claude Code. I can only code in a few very specific programming languages (mostly used in statistics) and have no experience at all with Linux machines. Yet Claude Code only runs in Linux. Fortunately, Claude told me how to handle my problems, so after some vibetroubleshooting (seriously, if you haven t used AI for technical support, you should) I was able to set up Claude Code. Time to vibecode. The very first thing I typed into Claude Code was: make a 3D game where I can place buildings of various designs and then drive through the town i create. That was it, grammar and spelling issues included. I got a working application (Claude helpfully launched it in my browser for me) about four minutes later, with no further input from me. You can see the results in the video below. It was pretty neat, but a little boring, so I wrote: hmmm its all a little boring (also sometimes the larger buildings don't place properly). Maybe I control a firetruck and I need to put out fires in buildings? We could add traffic and stuff. A couple minutes later, it made my car into a fire truck, added traffic, and made it so houses burst into flame. Now we were getting somewhere, but there were still things to fix. I gave Claude feedback: looking better, but the firetruck changes appearance when moving (wheels suddenly appear) and there is no issue with traffic or any challe",

I updated the post with that information. The only significant change is that Claude 3 is now referred to as an advanced model but not a Gen3 model. I have been experimenting with the first of a new generation AI models, Claude 3.7 and Grok 3, for the last few days. Grok 3 is the first model that we know trained with an order of magnitude more computing power of GPT-4, and Claude includes new coding and reasoning capabilities, so they are not just interesting in their own right but also tell us something important about where AI is going. Before we get there, a quick review: this new generation of AIs is smarter and the jump in capabilities is striking, particularly in how these models handle complex tasks, math and code. These models often give me the same feeling I had when using ChatGPT-4 for the first time, where I am equally impressed and a little unnerved by what it can do. Take Claude's native coding ability, I can now get working programs through natural conversation or documents, no programming skill needed. For example, giving Claude a proposal for a new AI educational tool and engaging in conversation where it was asked to display the proposed system architecture in 3D, make it interactive , resulted in this interactive visualization of the core design in our paper, with no errors. You can try it yourself here , and edit or change it by asking the AI. The graphics, while neat, are not the impressive part.

It quickly became the most influential thing either of us had ever done. 1 We took this as a strong signal to spend more of our time thinking and writing about the medium-term future of AI and its impacts, offering grounded analysis of a topic that tends to attract speculation. This is a shift in focus away from writing about the present-day and near-term impacts of AI, which is what the AI Snake Oil project was about. Reflecting this shift, we have renamed this newsletter. We have already published two follow-up essays to AI as Normal Technology and will publish more regularly as we expand our framework into a book, which we plan to complete in late 2026 for publication in 2027. Today, we address common points of confusion about AI as Normal Technology, try to make the original essay more approachable, and compare it to AI 2027 .

Confronting the production-progress paradox AI leaders have predicted that it will enable dramatic scientific progress : curing cancer, doubling the human lifespan, colonizing space, and achieving a century of progress in the next decade. Given the cuts to federal funding for science in the U.S., the timing seems perfect, as AI could replace the need for a large scientific workforce. It s a common-sense view, at least among technologists, that AI will speed science greatly as it gets adopted in every part of the scientific pipeline summarizing existing literature, generating new ideas, performing data analyses and experiments to test them, writing up findings, and performing peer review. But many early common-sense predictions about the impact of a new technology on an existing institution proved badly wrong. The Catholic Church welcomed the printing press as a way of solidifying its authority by printing Bibles. The early days of social media led to wide-eyed optimism about the spread of democracy worldwide following the Arab Spring. Similarly, the impact of AI on science could be counterintuitive. Even if individual scientists benefit from adopting AI, it doesn t mean science as a whole will benefit. When thinking about the macro effects, we are dealing with a complex system with emergent properties. That system behaves in surprising ways because it is not a market. It is better than markets at some things, like rewarding truth, but worse at others, such as reacting to technological shocks. So far, on balance, AI has been an unhealthy shock to science, stretching many of its processes to the breaking point. Any serious attempt to forecast the impact of AI on science must confront the production-progress paradox . The rate of publication of scientific papers has been growing exponentially, increasing 500 fold between 1900 and 2015.

    "text": "AGI is not a milestone There is no capability threshold that will lead to sudden impacts With the release of OpenAI s latest model o3, there is renewed debate about whether Artificial General Intelligence has already been achieved. The standard skeptic s response to this is that there is no consensus on the definition of AGI. That is true, but misses the point if AGI is such a momentous milestone, shouldn t it be obvious when it has been built? In this essay, we argue that AGI is not a milestone. It does not represent a discontinuity in the properties or impacts of AI systems. If a company declares that it has built AGI, based on whatever definition, it is not an actionable event. It will have no implications for businesses, developers, policymakers, or safety. Specifically: Even if general-purpose AI systems reach some agreed-upon capability threshold, we will need many complementary innovations that allow AI to diffuse across industries to realize its productive impact. Diffusion occurs at human (and societal) timescales, not at the speed of tech development. Worries about AGI and catastrophic risk often conflate capabilities with power. Once we distinguish between the two, we can reject the idea of a critical point in AI development at which it becomes infeasible for humanity to remain in control. The proliferation of AGI definitions is a symptom, not the disease. AGI is significant because of its presumed impacts but must be defined based on properties of the AI system itself. But the link between system properties and impacts is tenuous, and greatly depends on how we design the environment in which AI systems operate. Thus, whether or not a given AI system will go on to have transformative impacts is yet to be determined at the moment the system is released. So a determination that an AI system constitutes AGI can only meaningfully be made retrospectively .

We are pleased to announce that an expanded version of these ideas will become our next book together. The paper is also published in HTML and PDF formats on the Knight First Amendment Institute s website. We are grateful for the extensive feedback we ve received on drafts of the paper. Update (September 2025) : We have published a companion to this essay titled A guide to understanding AI as normal technology . We articulate a vision of artificial intelligence (AI) as normal technology . To view AI as normal is not to understate its impact even transformative, general-purpose technologies such as electricity and the internet are normal in our conception. But it is in contrast to both utopian and dystopian visions of the future of AI which have a common tendency to treat it akin to a separate species, a highly autonomous, potentially superintelligent entity. 1 The statement AI is normal technology is three things: a description of current AI, a prediction about the foreseeable future of AI, and a prescription about how we should treat it. We view AI as a tool that we can and should remain in control of, and we argue that this goal does not require drastic policy interventions or technical breakthroughs. We do not think that viewing AI as a humanlike intelligence is currently accurate or useful for understanding its societal impacts, nor is it likely to be in our vision of the future. 2 The normal technology frame is about the relationship between technology and society. It rejects technological determinism, especially the notion of AI itself as an agent in determining its future. It is guided by lessons from past technological revolutions, such as the slow and uncertain nature of technology adoption and diffusion. It also emphasizes continuity between the past and the future trajectory of AI in terms of societal impact and the role of institutions in shaping this trajectory. In",

    "text": "Is AI progress slowing down? Making sense of recent technology trends and claims By Arvind Narayanan, Benedikt Str bl, and Sayash Kapoor . After the release of GPT-4 in March 2023, the dominant narrative in the tech world was that continued scaling of models would lead to artificial general intelligence and then superintelligence. Those extreme predictions gradually receded, but up until a month ago, the prevailing belief in the AI industry was that model scaling would continue for the foreseeable future. Then came three back-to-back news reports from The Information , Reuters , and Bloomberg revealing that three leading AI developers OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google Gemini had all run into problems with their next-gen models. Many industry insiders, including Ilya Sutskever, probably the most notable proponent of scaling, are now singing a very different tune: The 2010s were the age of scaling, now we're back in the age of wonder and discovery once again. Everyone is looking for the next thing, Sutskever said. Scaling the right thing matters more now than ever. (Reuters) The new dominant narrative seems to be that model scaling is dead, and inference scaling , also known as test-time compute scaling is the way forward for improving AI capabilities. The idea is to spend more and more computation when using models to perform a task, such as by having them think before responding. This has left AI observers confused about whether or not progress in AI capabilities is slowing down. In this essay, we look at the evidence on this question, and make four main points: Declaring the death of model scaling is premature. Regardless of whether model scaling will continue, industry leaders flip flopping on this issue shows the folly of trusting their forecasts. They are not significantly better informed than the rest of us, and their narratives are heavily influenced by their vested interests.

AI-generated misinformation was one of the top concerns during the 2024 U.S. presidential election. In January 2024, the World Economic Forum claimed that misinformation and disinformation is the most severe short-term risk the world faces and that AI is amplifying manipulated and distorted information that could destabilize societies. News headlines about elections in 2024 tell a similar story: In contrast, in our past writing, we predicted that AI would not lead to a misinformation apocalypse. When Meta released its open-weight large language model (called LLaMA), we argued that it would not lead to a tidal wave of misinformation. And in a follow-up essay, we pointed out that the distribution of misinformation is the key bottleneck for influence operations, and while generative AI reduces the cost of creating misinformation, it does not reduce the cost of distributing it. A few other researchers have made similar arguments . Which of these two perspectives better fits the facts? Fortunately, we have the evidence of AI use in elections that took place around the globe in 2024 to help answer this question. Many news outlets and research projects have compiled known instances of AI-generated text and media and their impact. Instead of speculating about AI s potential, we can look at its real-world impact to date. We analyzed every instance of AI use in elections collected by the WIRED AI Elections Project , which tracked known uses of AI for creating political content during elections taking place in 2024 worldwide. In each case, we identified what AI was used for and estimated the cost of creating similar content without AI. We find that (1) half of AI use isn't deceptive, (2) deceptive content produced using AI is nevertheless cheap to replicate without AI, and (3) focusing on the demand for misinformation rather than the supply is a much more effective way to diagnose problems and identify interventions.

Seemingly minor technical decisions can have life-or-death effects By Arvind Narayanan, Angelina Wang, Sayash Kapoor, and Solon Barocas Predictive algorithms are used in many life-or-death situations. In the paper Against Predictive Optimization , we argued that the use of predictive logic for making decisions about people has recurring, inherent flaws, and should be rejected in many cases. A wrenching case study comes from the UK s liver allocation algorithm, which appears to discriminate by age , with some younger patients seemingly unable to receive a transplant, no matter how ill. What went wrong here? Can it be fixed? Or should health systems avoid using algorithms for liver transplant matching? How the liver allocation algorithm works The UK nationalized its liver transplant system in 2018, replacing previous regional systems where livers were prioritized based on disease severity. 1 When a liver becomes available, the new algorithm uses predictive logic to calculate how much each patient on the national waiting list would benefit from being given that liver. Specifically, the algorithm predicts how long each patient would live if they were given that liver, and how long they would live if they didn t get a transplant. The difference between the two is the patient s Transplant Benefit Score (TBS). Patients are sorted in decreasing order of the score, and the top patient is offered the liver (if they decline, the next patient is offered, and so on). Given this description, one would expect that the algorithm would favor younger patients, as they will potentially gain many more decades of life through a transplant compared to older patients. If the algorithm has the opposite effect, either the score has been inaccurately portrayed or it is being calculated incorrectly. We ll see which one it is. But first, let s discuss a more basic question. Why is predictive AI even needed?

We re grateful for the level of interest it s sold about 8,000 copies so far. We ve received many questions about the book, both its substance and the writing process. Here are the most common ones. Why don t you recognize the benefits of AI? We do! The book is not an anti-technology screed. If our point was that all AI is useless, we wouldn t need a whole book to say it. It s precisely because of AI s usefulness in many areas that hype and snake oil have been successful it s hard for people to tell these apart, and we hope our book can help. We also recognize that the harms we describe are usually not solely due to tech, and much more often due to AI being an amplifier of existing problems in our society. A recurring pattern we point out in the book is that \"broken AI is appealing to broken institutions\" (Chapter 8). What s your optimistic vision for AI, then? There s a humorous definition of AI that says AI is whatever hasn t been done yet . When an AI application starts working reliably, it disappears into the background of our digital or physical world. We take it for granted. And we stop calling it AI. When a technology is new, doesn t work reliably, and has double-edged societal implications, we re more likely to call it AI. So it s easy to miss that AI already plays a huge positive role in our lives. There s a long list of applications that would have been called AI at one point but probably wouldn t be today: Robot vacuum cleaners, web search, autopilot in planes, autocomplete, handwriting recognition, speech recognition, spam filtering, and even spell check. These are the kinds of AI we want more of reliable tools that quietly make our lives better.

It has no checks for novelty, so generated papers could rehash earlier work. And Sakana did not perform any human review (let alone expert peer review) of the generated papers so it is unclear if the papers are any good (apparently they are not ). While these flaws are particularly flagrant in Sakana's case, the lack of good evaluation affects most AI agents, making it hard to measure their real-world impact.

This has led to a chorus of concerns that generative AI is a bubble . We won t offer any predictions on what s about to happen. But we think we have a solid diagnosis of how things got to this point in the first place. In this post, we explain the mistakes that AI companies have made and how they have been trying to correct them. Then we will talk about five barriers they still have to overcome in order to make generative AI commercially successful enough to justify the investment. Product-market fit When ChatGPT launched, people found a thousand unexpected uses for it. This got AI developers overexcited. They completely misunderstood the market, underestimating the huge gap between proofs of concept and reliable products. This misunderstanding led to two opposing but equally flawed approaches to commercializing LLMs. OpenAI and Anthropic focused on building models and not worrying about products. For example, it took 6 months for OpenAI to bother to release a ChatGPT iOS app and 8 months for an Android app! Google and Microsoft shoved AI into everything in a panicked race, without thinking about which products would actually benefit from AI and how they should be integrated. Both groups of companies forgot the make something people want mantra. The generality of LLMs allowed developers to fool themselves into thinking that they were exempt from the need to find a product-market fit, as if prompting a model to perform a task is a replacement for carefully designed products or features. OpenAI and Anthropic s DIY approach meant that early adopters of LLMs disproportionately tended to be bad actors, since they are more invested in figuring out how to adapt new technologies for their purposes, whereas everyday users want easy-to-use products. This has contributed to a poor public perception of the technology. 1 Meanw",

On the one hand, existential risks (x-risks) are necessarily somewhat speculative: by the time there is concrete evidence, it may be too late. On the other hand, governments must prioritize after all, they don t worry too much about x-risk from alien invasions. This is the first in a series of essays laying out an evidence-based approach for policymakers concerned about AI x-risk, an approach that stays grounded in reality while acknowledging that there are unknown unknowns . In this first essay, we look at one type of evidence: probability estimates. The AI safety community relies heavily on forecasting the probability of human extinction due to AI (in a given timeframe) in order to inform decision making and policy. An estimate of 10% over a few decades, for example, would obviously be high enough for the issue to be a top priority for society. Our central claim is that AI x-risk forecasts are far too unreliable to be useful for policy, and in fact highly misleading. Subscribe to receive future essays in this series. Look behind the curtain If the two of us predicted an 80% probability of aliens landing on earth in the next ten years, would you take this possibility seriously? Of course not. You would ask to see our evidence. As obvious as this may seem, it seems to have been forgotten in the AI x-risk debate that probabilities carry no authority by themselves. Probabilities are usually derived from some grounded method, so we have a strong cognitive bias to view quantified risk estimates as more valid than qualitative ones. But it is possible for probabilities to be nothing more than guesses. Keep this in mind throughout this essay (and more broadly in the AI x-risk debate).

    "text": "New paper: AI agents that matter Rethinking AI agent benchmarking and evaluation Some of the most exciting applications of large language models involve taking real-world action, such as booking flight tickets or finding and fixing software bugs. AI systems that carry out such tasks are called agents. They use LLMs in combination with other software to use tools such as web search and code terminals. The North Star of this field is to build assistants like Siri or Alexa and get them to actually work handle complex tasks, accurately interpret users requests, and perform reliably. But this is far from a reality, and even the research direction is fairly new. To stimulate the development of agents and measure their effectiveness, researchers have created benchmark datasets. But as we ve said before, LLM evaluation is a minefield , and it turns out that agent evaluation has a bunch of additional pitfalls that affect today s benchmarks and evaluation practices. This state of affairs encourages the development of agents that do well on benchmarks without being useful in practice. We have released a new paper that identifies the challenges in evaluating agents and proposes ways to address them. Read the paper here . The authors are Sayash Kapoor, Benedikt Str bl , Zachary S.

    "text": "AI scaling myths Scaling will run out. The question is when. So far, bigger and bigger language models have proven more and more capable. But does the past predict the future? One popular view is that we should expect the trends that have held so far to continue for many more orders of magnitude, and that it will potentially get us to artificial general intelligence, or AGI. This view rests on a series of myths and misconceptions. The seeming predictability of scaling is a misunderstanding of what research has shown. Besides, there are signs that LLM developers are already at the limit of high-quality training data. And the industry is seeing strong downward pressure on model size. While we can't predict exactly how far AI will advance through scaling, we think there s virtually no chance that scaling alone will lead to AGI. Scaling laws are often misunderstood Research on scaling laws shows that as we increase model size, training compute, and dataset size, language models get better . The improvement is truly striking in its predictability, and holds across many orders of magnitude. This is the main reason why many people believe that scaling will continue for the foreseeable future, with regular releases of larger, more powerful models from leading AI companies. But this is a complete misinterpretation of scaling laws. What exactly is a better model? Scaling laws only quantify the decrease in perplexity, that is, improvement in how well models can predict the next word in a sequence.

Emergence is not governed by any law-like behavior. It is true that so far, increases in scale have brought new capabilities. But there is no empirical regularity that gives us confidence that this will continue indefinitely. 1 Why might emergence not continue indefinitely?

    "text": "Scientists should use AI as a tool, not an oracle How AI hype leads to flawed research that fuels more hype Who produces AI hype? As we discuss in the AI Snake Oil book , it is not just companies and the media but also AI researchers. For example, a pair of widely-publicized papers in Nature in December 2023 claimed to have discovered over 2.2 million new materials using AI, and robotically synthesized 41 of them. Unfortunately, the claims were quickly debunked : Most of the [41] materials produced were misidentified, and the rest were already known . As for the large dataset, examining a sample of 250 compounds showed that it was mostly junk . A core selling point of machine learning is discovery without understanding, which is why errors are particularly common in machine-learning-based science. Three years ago, we compiled evidence revealing that an error called leakage the machine learning version of teaching to the test was pervasive, affecting hundreds of papers from 17 disciplines. Since then, we have been trying to understand the problem better and devise solutions. This post presents an update. In short, we think things will get worse before they get better, although there are glimmers of hope on the horizon. The carnage continues In our most recent compilation, the number of disciplines where researchers have uncovered leakage in published work has reached 30. The majority are medical fields, which we strongly suspect is due to the fact that since errors in medical research can be particularly consequential, medical fields seem to put much more effort into establishing best practices and critically reviewing previously published work. About 650 papers across all fields are affected, which we hypothesize is a vast underestimate when researchers look for leakage systematically, in many fields they find that the majority of sampled studies commit the error of leakage. Leakage is one of many reasons for reproducibility failures. There are widespread shortcomings in every step of ML-based science, from data collection to preprocessing and reporting results.

What spending $2,000 can tell us about evaluating AI agents By Sayash Kapoor, Benedikt Stroebl , Arvind Narayanan Which is the most accurate AI system for generating code? Surprisingly, there isn t currently a good way to answer questions like these. Based on HumanEval , a widely used benchmark for code generation, the most accurate publicly available system is LDB (short for LLM debugger). 1 But there s a catch. The most accurate generative AI systems, including LDB, tend to be agents, 2 which repeatedly invoke language models like GPT-4. That means they can be orders of magnitude more costly to run than the models themselves (which are already pretty costly). If we eke out a 2% accuracy improvement for 100x the cost, is that really better? In this post, we argue that: AI agent accuracy measurements that don t control for cost aren t useful. Pareto curves can help visualize the accuracy-cost tradeoff. Current state-of-the-art agent architectures are complex and costly but no more accurate than extremely simple baseline agents that cost 50x less in some cases. Proxies for cost such as parameter count are misleading if the goal is to identify the best system for a given task. We should directly measure dollar costs instead. Published agent evaluations are difficult to reproduce because of a lack of standardization and questionable, undocumented evaluation methods in some cases. Maximizing accuracy can lead to unbounded cost LLMs are stochastic. Simply calling a model many times and outputting the most common answer can increase accuracy. On some tasks, there is seemingly no limit to the amount of inference compute that can improve accuracy. 3 Google Deepmind's AlphaCode , which improved accuracy on automated coding evaluations, showed that this trend holds even when calling LLMs millions of times. The accuracy of AlphaCode on coding tasks continues to improve even after making a million calls to the underlying model (the different curves represent varying parameter counts). Accuracy is measured by how often one of the top 10",

The publication date is September 24, 2024. If you have enjoyed reading our newsletter and would like to support our work, please preorder the book via Amazon , Bookshop , or your favorite bookseller. What s in the book We get two recurring questions about the book: In an area as fast moving as AI, how long can a book stay relevant? How similar is the book to the newsletter? The answer to both questions is the same. We know that book publishing moves at a slower timescale than AI. So the book is about the foundational knowledge needed to separate real advances from hype, rather than commentary on breaking developments. In writing every chapter, and every paragraph, we asked ourselves: will this be relevant in five years? This also means that there s very little overlap between the newsletter and the book. AI Snake Oil book cover In the book, we explain the crucial differences between types of AI, why people, companies, and governments are falling for AI snake oil, why AI can t fix social media, and why we should be far more worried about what people will do with AI than about anything AI will do on its own. While generative AI is what drives press, predictive AI used in criminal justice, finance, healthcare, and other domains remains far more consequential in people s lives. We discuss in depth how predictive AI can go wrong. We also warn of the dangers of a world where AI continues to be controlled by largely unaccountable big tech companies. The book is not just an explainer. Every chapter includes original scholarship. We plan to release exercises and discussion questions for classroom use; courses on the relationship between tech and society might benefit from the book.

In our experience, most of the time when we engage with policymakers there is no discernible impact. 1 But when we do make a difference to public policy, the impact is much bigger than what we can accomplish through academic work. So we find it fruitful to engage even if it feels frustrating on a day-to-day basis. In this post, we summarize some common reasons why many people are cynical about tech policy and explain why we re cautiously optimistic. We also announce some recent writings on tech policy as well as an upcoming event for policymakers in Washington D.C., called AI Policy Precepts . Tech is not exceptional Some people want more tech regulation and others want less. But both sides seem to mostly agree that policymakers are bad at regulating tech: because they don t have tech expertise; or because tech moves too rapidly for law to keep up; or because policymakers are bad at anticipating the effects of regulation. While these claims have a kernel of truth, they aren t reasons for defeatism. It's true that most politicians don't have deep technical knowledge. But their job is not to be subject matter experts . The details of legislation are delegated to staffers, many of whom are experts on the subject. Moreover, much of tech policy is handled by agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which do have tech experts on their staff. There aren t enough, but that s being addressed in many ways . Finally, while federal legislators and agencies get the most press, a lot happens on the state and local levels. Besides, policy does not have to move at the speed of tech. Policy is concerned with technology s effect on people, not the technology itself. And policy has longstanding approaches to protecting humans that can be adapted to address new challenges from tech.

    "text": "AI safety is not a model property Trying to make an AI model that can t be misused is like trying to make a computer that can t be used for bad things The assumption that AI safety is a property of AI models is pervasive in the AI community. It is seen as so obvious that it is hardly ever explicitly stated. Because of this assumption: Companies have made big investments in red teaming their models before releasing them. Researchers are frantically trying to fix the brittleness of model alignment techniques. Some AI safety advocates seek to restrict open models given concerns that they might pose unique risks. Policymakers are trying to find the training compute threshold above which safety risks become serious enough to justify intervention (and lacking any meaningful basis for picking one, they seem to have converged on 10 26 rather arbitrarily). We think these efforts are inherently limited in their effectiveness. That s because AI safety is not a model property. With a few exceptions, AI safety questions cannot be asked and answered at the levels of models alone. Safety depends to a large extent on the context and the environment in which the AI model or AI system is deployed. We have to specify a particular context before we can even meaningfully ask an AI safety question. As a corollary, fixing AI safety at the model level alone is unlikely to be fruitful. Even if models themselves can somehow be made safe , they can easily be used for malicious purposes. That s because an adversary can deploy a model without giving it access to the details of the context in which it is deployed. Therefore we cannot delegate safety questions to models especially questions about misuse. The model will lack information that is necessary to make a correct decision. Based on this perspective, we make four recommendations for safety and red teaming that would represent a major change to how things are done today. Safety depends on context: three examples Consider the concern that LLMs can help hackers generate and send phishing emails to a large number of potential victims.

What I Learned From My Summer Co-op Position At McMaster Last February, in the midst of my second year of Chemical Engineering at McMaster University, I began applying for my first ever summer co-op. It was a long and winding road, but after countless applications and emails, I came out with an offer to join the Higgins research lab . I took my time deciding on whether to accept, with questions like Is research really something I m interested in? and What sort of skills will I need? drifting through my head. For advice, I consulted some friends that had previously spent a term in research. I was surprised to hear that their feedback was less than enthusiastic. For some, the extended months on a quiet campus wore them down; for others, the project work was tedious or unengaging. Despite the warnings, I decided to take the job, hoping that my experience would be different and it was! I loved my summer co-op, where I spent four vibrant months researching a new material for supercapacitor applications. It was filled with independence, curiosity, and camaraderie. In this piece, I ll give a review of my own research experience, providing the context and nuance that I wish I could have received during my own job search. I have tried to be honest, including both the ups and downs of research as I experienced it, but ultimately, I would recommend research as a great co-op option! Learning the Ropes of Research Let s start at the beginning. The first step of any good research project is reading... lots of reading. No matter the project, most of the first month is spent working through papers (and the occasional YouTube summary) to get a solid understanding of important topics. Unfortunately, reading research papers is not the same as reading a good book; they can be dense, verbose, and tough to work through, especially at the start of the co-op term, and especially if you didn t sleep well the night before.

At first, this statement may seem a bit grandiose and conjure images of the great scientists to come before our time Marie Curie comes to mind first for me. Like a statement that should just be an unspoken, but universally accepted truth. However, I believe that giant should not be assigned solely to those who are listed in our textbooks or whose names are on the halls of our schools, but also to those who have helped us on the journey to get to where we are now. The professors, the colleagues, the students that surround us and mentor us to be better. Mentors make a difference that matters , and the quality of our mentors can change the trajectory of our work for better or for worse. As such, understanding what makes a good mentor and how to be an effective teacher is key to fostering the next generation of researchers. In the following sections, I have taken some of the words from my mentors as well as my own experience to outline what I believe are the best ways to be an effective mentor regardless of your field of study. Set Expectations To be an effective mentor, there is a general expectation that you will provide professional guidance while maintaining a friendly and supportive relationship with your mentee. Understanding this simple expectation helps mentors put the goals of the project into perspective. The same is true for the mentee. By setting clear expectations for them early on they are more likely to succeed and reach the goals that you both have. The following questions can help you start to set your own expectations for the mentee. What are the expected working hours? What is the best method for communication and what is the frequency of progress reporting? What are the learning outcomes and deliverables for this project?

Conferences are an opportunity for you to finally share the results of your hard work with your peers, and network with others in your field to hopefully get some perspective on areas of research you might not be as familiar with. Going to a conference can also be a daunting experience. From abstract submission, to applying for travel grants, there is no shortage of administrative hoops to jump through just to get there. And once you get to the conference, there s the anxiety of not knowing where to go or what presentation to see or who to talk to. It is important not to let this anxiety sabotage what is meant to be an incredible learning experience for you. The first step to overcoming this is to learn a bit more about what actually happens at a conference, to properly set your expectations for the event and clarify what the event s expectations are of you. While every conference is a bit different in terms of schedule, seeing how even one type of conference runs will give you some idea of how they all do.

Brutal. What direction do you take ? What should you learn first ? How do you get off the ground running with your project ? The best way to have a successful start to your project is to give yourself enough time to read. Read more than you think you need to . The learning curve for any graduate degree is steep and dedicating quality time to reading is your key to getting over it. Why is reading so important? It might seem obvious that reading is important, but at the start of your project it should arguably take precedent over any other aspect of your work. Why? Context A deep dive into the literature surrounding your work will give you context to how your project fits into a bigger picture. To help with this, ask yourself what do I want my work contribute to my field of study? and how will my work impact future research efforts? . Inspiration Seeing what others have done in the field will help you draw inspiration for the direction of your project. Learning about what is state-of-the-art in your field and reviewing how it got to that point will be an asset when you start to develop a plan of action. Understanding Reading will only lend itself to increasing your knowledge of the subject.

Subscribe now To understand the future of the world, stick AI systems in a petri dish: Evolving LLMs to attack other LLMs Researchers with Japanese AI startup Sakana have looked at what happens when they evolve LLM-based agents to fight against one another in a competitive programming game from the 1980s called Core War. The results show that large language models (LLMs) drive an adversarial evolutionary arms race in this domain, where programs continuously adapt to defeat a growing history of opponents rather than a static benchmark . This research approach gestures both at ways researchers might better study how LLM-dominated niches in the economy or national security world might unfold, and also hints at the strange AI world we re heading into. What is Core War? Core War is a competitive programming game played out in a shared block of computer memory, called the Core, where two or more assembly programs fight for survival , Sakana writes. Each program, known as a warrior , is written in an assembly language called Redcode. These programs are tasked with crashing their competitors while keeping their own processes alive. The simulation runs by alternating between the programs, executing one instruction at a time. A warrior attacks by writing invalid instructions (DAT commands) into the memory slots occupied by opponents, causing them to crash upon execution. DRQ: To evolve their programs, the authors use a technique they call Digital Red Queen. DRQ uses MAP-Elites, a quality-diversity algorithm, to optimize warriors within each round, preventing diversity collapse during search. By playing against all previous round champions, DRQ avoids cyclic adaptations across rounds, consistent with techniques in prior work , they write.

They ve published their reasoning in a paper which reads both as aspirational and earnest. Ideally, humans and machines will work together to build a smarter-than-human system, and the researchers think we should develop a research agenda targeting improving AI systems ability to work with human researchers to conduct AI research together, from ideation to experimentation, in order to both accelerate AI research and to generally endow both AIs and humans with safer superintelligence through their symbiosis. The thesis here is that co-improvement can provide: (i) faster progress to find important paradigm shifts; (ii) more transparency and steerability than direct self-improvement in making this progress; (iii) more focus on human-centered safe AI.

Subscribe now AI systems will ultimately absorb power from humans rather than grant us power: Control Inversion gestures at some of the hardest parts of AI safety A new research paper from Anthony Aguirre at the Future of Life Institute called Control Inversion warns that as we build increasingly capable AI systems they will absorb power from our world, rather than grant us power. This means even if we somehow make it through without being outright killed we will have unwittingly disempowered and defanged the human species. As AI becomes more intelligent, general, and especially autonomous, it will less and less bestow power as a tool does and more and more absorb power. This means that a race to build AGI and superintelligence is ultimately self-defeating, he writes. The race to build powerful AI is one where success puts in conflict with an entity that would be faster, more strategic, and more capable than ourselves - a losing proposition regardless of initial constraints . Cruxes for the argument: The basis for the argument is the incommensurability in speed, complexity, and depth of thought between humans and superintelligence , which renders control either impossible or meaningless. The author brings this to life with a helpful analogy - imagine you re a human CEO of a human company, but you run at 1/50th the speed of the company itself. This means that when you go to sleep it s like multiple work weeks pass for the company. What happens in",

Subscribe now Language models don t have very fixed beliefs and you can change their minds: If you want to change an LLM s mind, just talk to it for a while Here s some intuitive research from CMU, Princeton, and Stanford which shows that language models can change their stated beliefs and behaviors during the course of a single conversation. This will make sense to anyone who has spent time jailbreaking language models, as often many of the most successful jailbreaks involve flooding the language model with context designed to move them away from some safety conditioning. What they studied: Here, the authors study LLMs under two different paradigms - intentional interaction, where a language model is persuaded or debated into changing its beliefs, and non-intentional interaction, where a language model is just provided further context or invited to do its own research on a topic and this causes beliefs to change. All LLMs change their minds: They study open- and closed-weight LLMs, including GPT-5, Claude-4-Sonnet, GPT-OSS-120B, and DeepSeek-V3.1. As LM assistants engage in extended conversations or read longer texts, their stated beliefs and behaviors change substantially, the authors write. All the LLMs change their minds, but to different extents in different situations. For instance, GPT-5 shows a 54.7% shift in stated beliefs after 10 rounds of discussion about moral dilemmas and safety queries, and Grok-4 shows a 27.2% shift on political issues after reading texts from opposing positions. In reading and research, we see small belief changes that amplify with in-depth reading, with larger shifts for longer content and more coherent exposure, they write. Stated beliefs change early (within 2-4 rounds), while behavioral changes accumulate over longer interactions (up to 10 rounds), Why this matters - b",

Get it to dream: .World models could help us bootstrap robot R&D Researchers with Stanford University and Tsinghua University have built Ctrl-World, a world model to help robots imagine how to complete tasks and also generate synthetic data to improve their own performance. What s a world model: A world model is basically a way to help AI systems dream about a specific environment, turning a learned data distribution into a dynamic and responsive interactive world in which you can train and refine AI agents. World models are likely going to be used to create infinite, procedural games, such as Mirage 2 ( Import AI #426 ) or DeepMind s Genie 3 ( Import AI #424 ). What is Ctrl-World: Ctrl-World is initialized from a pretrained 1.5B Stable-Video-Diffusion (SVD) model, then adapted into a controllable, temporally consistent world model with: (1) Multi-view input and joint prediction for unified information understanding. (2) Memory retrieval mechanism, which adds sparse history frames in context and project pose information into each frame via frame-level cross-attention, re-anchoring predictions to similar past states. (3) Frame-level action conditioning to better align high-frequency action with visual dynamics. The result is a controllable world model for robot manipulation using a single gripper and a variety of cameras. In experiments, we find this model enables a new imagination-based workflow in which policies can be both evaluated with ranking alignment to real-world rollouts and improved through targeted synthetic data that boosts success rates. What does it let you do? Test out things and generate data: As everyone knows, testing out robots in the real world is grindingly slow and painful. Ctrl-World gives people",

Subscribe now We re very close to AI-based malware that runs locally: A smart agent that lives off the land is within reach Security company Dreadnode has prototyped some AI malware which runs locally and exploits on-device LLMs to smartly and autonomously hack a system. While this is very much a prototype it gestures at a world of malware which doesn t need command-and-control servers to operate, instead living off of its local computer and exploiting the AI system to do mischief. The motivation: Instead of having beaconing behavior, which resembles C2 communication if you squint, can we live off the land ? In other words, is it possible for an attacker to make the victim computer run inference and does the victim computer have an LLM?, the authors ask. With CoPilot+ PCs, it s entirely possible to live off the land! A model is shipped with the computer without the need to embed or statically link to an inference library. What the prototype does: The prototype malware does local privilege escalation via misconfigured services. The goal of the model is to find a misconfigured service running as an administrator, abuse it, and create a file C:\\proof.txt. This is a valuable proof-of-concept because it embodies the behavior of genuinely scary things in the world. How they did it: I developed this malware with C++ and ONNX Runtime for inference, the Phi-3-mini model, and sol2 for the Lua runtime . The main work here was twofold: 1) writing some custom tools the (relatively dumb) model could use to navigate and understand the Windows environment, and 2) writing a prompt for the language model that helps it perform well.

My answer is this is not load-bearing at all. Rather, things like situational awareness in AI systems are a symptom of something fiendishly complex happening inside the system which we can neither fully explain or predict - this is inherently very scary, and for the purpose of my feelings and policy ideas it doesn t matter whether this behavior stems from some odd larping of acting like a person or if it comes from some self-awareness inside the machine itself. Technological Optimism and Appropriate Fear Remarks given at The Curve conference in Berkeley, California, as the sun began to set. CHILDREN IN THE DARK I remember being a child and after the lights turned out I would look around my bedroom and I would see shapes in the darkness and I would become afraid - afraid these shapes were creatures I did not understand that wanted to do me harm. And so I d turn my light on. And when I turned the light on I would be relieved because the creatures turned out to be a pile of clothes on a chair, or a bookshelf, or a lampshade. Now, in the year of 2025, we are the child from that story and the room is our planet. But when we turn the light on we find ourselves gazing upon true creatures, in the form of the powerful and somewhat unpredictable AI systems of today and those that are to come. And there are many people who desperately want to believe that these creatures are nothing but a pile of clothes on a chair, or a bookshelf, or a lampshade.

Yes, if people believe in powerful AI AI policy people are caught in a trap neatly illustrated by a research paper from RAND: is it better to deeply inform policymakers about the world-changing nature of powerful AI, or is it better to mostly not discuss this with them and hope that the powerful machines can create stability upon their arrival? Though most people would immediately reach for keeping people in the dark is crazy, you should inform people! as a response, it isn t an ironclad response to this challenge. In Evaluating the Risks of Preventive Attack in the Race for Advanced AI , RAND highlights this, with a research paper whose findings suggest that the odds of preventive attack are highest if leaders believe that AGI will cause explosive growth and decisive military advantages, especially if they also expect rapid changes and durable first-mover advantages from developing and adopting AGI first. In other words: you are more likely to carry out attacks on other countries to prevent them getting to AGI if you re in the lead and you believe the technology is immensely powerful. Uh oh! Further details: Preventive attacks are where a nation does something so as to preserve an advantage or prevent a rival having an upper hand. Preventive attacks are most likely to occur when a state expects a large shift in the balance of power that will leave it vulnerable to predation by a hostile rival and when it believes that using force is a cost-effective solution that will forestall its relative decline, RAND writes The development of AGI could create pressures for preventive action if leaders",

GDPval may end up being to broad real world economic impact as SWE-Bench is to coding impact, as far as evals go - which is a big deal! What it is: GDPval measures model performance on tasks drawn directly from the real-world knowledge work of experienced professionals across a wide range of occupations and sectors, providing a clearer picture on how models perform on economically valuable tasks. The benchmark tests out 9 industries across 44 occupations, including 1,230 specialized tasks each meticulously crafted and vetted by experienced professionals with over 14 years of experience on average from these fields . The dataset includes 30 fully reviewed tasks per occupation (full-set) with 5 tasks per occupation in our open-sourced gold set . Another nice property of the benchmark is that it involves multiple formats for response and tries to get at some of the messiness inherent to the real world. GDPval tasks are not simple text prompts, they write. They come with reference files and context, and the expected deliverables span documents, slides, diagrams, spreadsheets, and multimedia. This realism makes GDPval a more realistic test of how models might support professionals.

The dataset is captured by an RGB camera, stereo IR camera, a 6-Axis IMU, three 9-Axis IMU, and three GNSS receivers and wheel encoders. The dataset was gathered by a four-wheeled robot platform which is designed to automate the weeding of large crop fields. All of the gathered data was made through having the robot doing six varied runs over a soybean field, and all the data is synchronized and appropriately time-stamped. In tests, the researchers show that contemporary simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems fail to accurately predict the correct locations, often by breaking down during the course of a run. Why this matters - basic inputs for useful robots: As a rule, whenever you go into the real world, you tend to run into issues. Papers like this highlight how even simple-seeming tasks, like getting a robot in a soybean field to accurately figure out where it is and map its environment, is more challenging than people might suspect.

HeteroScale is interesting because it is a symptom of the internet-scale infrastructure which ByteDance operates and it gives us a sense of what AI systems look like when they're running at industrial scale. What is HeteroScale? HeteroScale is software for running LLMs at scale - and in particular, for efficiently trading off against the prefill and decode stages. Prefill is where you suck all the context (conversation history) into an LLM, and Decode is when you run predictions on that context. Prefill and Decode have very different computational needs, so being smart about what hardware you allocate P versus D to matters a lot for your system efficiency which ultimately dictates your profit margins. \"P/D disaggregation separates the compute-intensive prefill phase from the memory-bound decode phase, allowing for independent optimization,\" ByteDance writes. HeteroScale \"intelligently places different service roles on the most suitable hardware types, honoring network affinity and P/D balance simultaneously . HeteroScale is designed to address the unique challenges of autoscaling P/D disaggregated LLM services. The system consists of three main layers: autoscaling layer with policy engine, federated pre-scheduling layer and sub-cluster scheduling layer.\" It works very well: \"it consistently delivers substantial performance benefits, saving hundreds of thousands of GPU-hours daily while boosting average GPU utilization by 26.6 percentage points and SM activity by 9.2 percentage points\".

Subscribe now Tackling ivory smuggling with image recognition models: Augmenting human experts via AI Researchers with Microsoft and the University of Washington have used some basic AI techniques and off-the-shelf components to better study the trade in illegal ivory smuggling, illustrating how modern AI technology is useful for a broad range of fields. The researchers used AI and a small amount of expert human labor to automatically identify signatures inscribed into the stolen ivory, which they were then able to use to better understand smuggling networks. What they did: The researchers built a system \"for extracting and analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel, scalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence.\" They did this using an underlying dataset of 6,085 photographs collected from eight large seizures of ivory. They used an object detection model (MM-Grounding-Dino) to extract over 17,000 individual markings on the ivory, then labeled and described these using a mixture of expert human labeling and a supervised learning model. This ultimately helped them identify 184 recurring \"signature markings\" on some of the tusks, including 20 signatures which were observed in multiple seizures. Why this matters: \"Within a seizure, the occurrence frequency of signature markings can provide an indication as to the role played by the entities that the markings represent,\" the authors write. \"The distribution of marking frequencies can help uncover the number of individuals moving ivory from its source to where it s being consolidated for export.\" Additionally, \"Handwriting evidence can also fill in the gaps for seizures where genetic data is entirely unavailable.

What they did: This research paper lays out a recipe they used to get good quality video generation to fit into a small enough computational package that they can fit it on a phone. Their resulting model is 0.9B parameters (versus ~1-2B for other similarly small-sized models) and obtains decent but not state-of-the-art scores on video quality. To make the model, they started with a 2B parameter Diffusion Transformer then 'pruned' it to get it down to under a billion parameters so it could fit on an iPhone. They also do finetuning to take this pruned model and get it to generate higher quality outputs. The results are quite good - I'd encourage readers to check out the site to get a feel for them. Why this matters: Soon, your phone will be generating not just on-device text and images, but videos, as this research shows.

CLIP is a utility technology which is used for a vast range of downstream purposes, from image generation to image search and classification. The original CLIP was trained to map English text to images. Meta CLIP 2 is a scaled up version which also maps non-English text to images. Along with releasing the model, Meta has also released a detailed paper going through \"the first recipe training CLIP from scratch on worldwide web-scale image-text pairs\". Scale is all that matters: As usual, the main lesson here is one of scale. Earlier attempts to train versions of CLIP on multiple languages failed, leading to degraded performance relative to the original model. \"We empirically show that the curse of multilinguality in CLIP is the consequence of insufficient scaling due to the lack of a proper recipe for worldwide data curation and model training\". To scale the system, Meta had to do three things: 1) it gathered large-scale multilingual metadata across 300+ languages, 2) it built its own curation algorithm to help it curate a representative multilingual dataset to train on, and 3) it figured out the right proportion and ordering of data to use when training its system.

Chips and Autonomous Car Project, Grok is undressing anyone, NY passes AI regulation Nvidia Details New A.I. Chips and Autonomous Car Project With Mercedes Related: Nvidia launches Alpamayo, open AI models that allow autonomous vehicles to think like a human Nvidia launches Vera Rubin AI computing platform at CES 2026 At CES 2026, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced the company s new AI chip, Vera Rubin, which will begin shipping to customers like Microsoft and Amazon in the second half of the year. The chip represents a major efficiency leap, requiring only one-quarter as many chips as its predecessor Blackwell for training AI models and delivering inference at one-tenth the cost. This advancement is critical for Nvidia to maintain its dominance in the AI chip market (over 90% share) amid rising competition from AMD and Google, while also addressing the soaring energy demands of AI data centers. Huang also unveiled Nvidia s ambitious push into autonomous vehicles with Alpamayo, an open-source AI model and simulation platform that enables vehicles to reason through complex driving scenarios like humans. Mercedes-Benz will begin shipping CLA cars with Nvidia s self-driving technology in early 2026, comparable to Tesla s Autopilot. The 10-billion-parameter Alpamayo 1 model uses chain-of-thought reasoning to navigate edge cases and explain its driving decisions, marking what Huang called the ChatGPT moment for physical AI. This diversification effort comes as Nvidia reported record financial performance with $31.9 billion in quarterly profit and expectations of $500 billion in annual sales.

Nvidia buying AI chip startup Groq s assets for about $20 billion in largest deal on record Nvidia agreed to license Groq s inference technology and acquire essentially all of its assets for about $20 billion in cash its largest deal to date according to Disruptive CEO Alex Davis, a major Groq investor. Groq, valued at $6.9 billion after raising $750 million three months ago, said it entered a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Nvidia and that CEO Jonathan Ross, President Sunny Madra, and other senior leaders will join Nvidia. In a note to employees, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the plan is to integrate Groq s low-latency processors into the NVIDIA AI factory architecture to broaden support for inference and real-time workloads. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress declined comment, and Huang emphasized Nvidia is licensing Groq s IP and hiring talent, not acquiring the company itself. Groq will continue operating independently under CFO-turned-CEO Simon Edwards, with GroqCloud excluded from the transaction and continuing without interruption. Davis said Nvidia is receiving all of Groq s assets aside from the nascent cloud business, effectively transferring the core chip IP and hardware. OpenAI opens ChatGPT to third-party apps via its Platform OpenAI is now accepting submissions for third-party apps inside ChatGPT, creating an app directory where approved tools are discoverable and usable directly in the ChatGPT interface. Developers can submit apps built with OpenAI models through the developer platform; listings undergo automated and manual review for policy compliance, safety, and technical reliability before approval. Once approved, apps appear alongside built-in tools and can be invoked in conversational workflows without external installs. The rollout is global, and eligibility depends on adherence to usage policies and quality guidelines, transitioning the prior ad hoc GPT sharing toward a structured marketplace.

    "text": "The Sequence Opinion #790: From Book Smarts to Street Smarts: How AI Benchmarks are Changing A shift from static benchmarks to dynamic evaluations is a key requirement of modern AI systems. If you ve been watching the loss curves lately, you might have noticed a structural transition in the field that is technically profound but metrics-poor. We are effectively moving from the era of the Chatbot a stochastic, next-token prediction engine to the era of the Agent a digital employee expected to navigate, reason, and execute long-horizon workflows. This isn t just a product update; it s a fundamental shift in the ontology of intelligence. For the last few years, the unit test for AI has been the static benchmark: a frozen list of questions and answers, basically digitized versions of the SATs or StackOverflow. We measured intelligence by the ability to retrieve information or compress the internet into a set of weights. But as we settle into 2026, the utility of these static numbers is collapsing. We are witnessing the saturation of datasets like MMLU and GSM8K, not necessarily because models have achieved human-level reasoning, but because they have effectively memorized the test. The vibe in the research community has shifted. We stopped celebrating 90% scores on math tests and started asking why that same model can t fix a simple bug in a repo without hallucinating a dependency. This essay explores that transition. We are moving from Question-Answer pairs to Observation-Action loops, and that requires us to build entirely new gymnasiums for these models to work out in.

    "text": "The Sequence AI of the Week #789: Recursive Language Models: Inside the MIT Research Everyone is Talking About What is prompts could become environments. There s a familiar moment anyone who has tried to use a frontier model as a serious reader has experienced: you paste in a long document (or a pile of documents), ask a crisp question, and the model responds with something that feels vaguely relevant. Not wrong in a glaring way. Just washed out. Like it skimmed the whole thing with sleepy eyes and then improvised. The usual remedy has been to fight length with length. Bigger context windows. More tokens. Just fit the world into the prompt. But the MIT CSAIL paper on Recursive Language Models (RLMs) pushes back on that instinct with a simple systems-level observation: for many tasks, the problem isn t that the model can t accept more text, it s that stuffing more text into attention is the wrong computational shape. Past a point, the model isn t reasoning over your input; it s drowning in it. The paper names the failure mode plainly: context rot . As prompts get longer, quality degrades. Not merely because we hit a hard context limit, but because even within that limit the model s effective working set becomes unmanageably large. Attention gets diluted, the signal-to-noise ratio drops, and the model begins to behave like a student forced to take an exam with every textbook in the library open at once. Technically allowed. Practically useless. Image Credit: MIT Read more",

NVIDIA unveiled the Rubin platform , and the headline isn t the chip itself, but the architecture. Jensen Huang s team introduced the Rubin GPU (featuring 288GB of HBM4 memory) paired with the new Vera CPU , designed to function not as discrete units but as a single AI supercomputer in a rack. With a claimed 5x jump in inference speed over Blackwell, NVIDIA is pushing the rack-scale paradigm (NVL72) as the new unit of compute. AMD , however, refused to play second fiddle.

There is a distinct, unsettling feeling when you write code for AI agents today. You spend weeks architecting a beautiful orchestration framework a complex Rube Goldberg machine of Python scripts, vector databases, regex parsers, and prompt chains only to wake up one Tuesday morning to find that a new checkpoint from OpenAI or Anthropic has rendered 80% of your repository obsolete. We are witnessing a relentless historical trend in the generative AI era. It is a specific flavor of Rich Sutton s The Bitter Lesson, playing out in real-time. In Sutton s original formulation, hand-coded features were consistently crushed by general methods that leveraged computation. 1 In our current era, the lesson is slightly different but equally bitter: Hand-coded system scaffolding is consistently crushed by model internalization. The history of the last three years is the history of capabilities migrating from the outside (the system, the prompt, the agent loop) to the inside (the weights, the activations, the forward pass).

These are development that have already showed quite a bit of promise and seems ready for most ambitious implementations If you ve been watching the loss curves over the last decade, the recipe has been surprisingly simple: take a Transformer, throw a massive pile of internet text at it, crank up the GPU cluster, and wait.

We built these incredible stochastic parrots that could complete your code, write poetry, and pass the bar exam, all by just really, really wanting to predict the next token.

Today we will Discuss: Key concepts of synthetic data generation for image models. NVIDIA s Synthetica method used to train robots. AI Concept of the Day: Synthetic Data Generation for Image Models Synthetic image data has moved from a niche trick to a core ingredient in modern vision systems. When real images are scarce, private, or unbalanced, synthetic pipelines let you generate pixels with known labels, push coverage into rare and long-tail cases, and iterate quickly on edge conditions. The key is choosing the right generator, the right control signals, and a rigorous quality-control loop so that synthetic variety actually translates into downstream gains. The first pillar is generative models . Diffusion models (text-to-image, image-to-image, inpainting) and GANs can produce high-fidelity scenes from prompts, masks, or reference images. Conditional controls class labels, segmentation maps, depth, keypoints, or edge maps add steerability; frameworks like classifier-free guidance, ControlNet-style conditioning, and style adapters let you target layout, pose, lighting, or brand aesthetics. Latent editing (prompt interpolation, attention control, LoRA adapters) turns one base generator into many styles. For dataset growth, you typically script a prompt program (scene graph caption template), generate candidate images, then auto-label with the same controls you used to condition generation.

While Nvidia solidified its iron grip on inference hardware through a strategic acqui-hire of Groq s leadership, China s leading model labs Zhipu AI and MiniMax simultaneously released frontier-class models and cleared major regulatory hurdles for Hong Kong IPOs. The holiday headlines were dominated by Nvidia s decisive move to license Groq s LPU (Language Processing Unit) technology and hire its core leadership, including founder Jonathan Ross. While rumors initially pegged this as a $20 billion acquisition, the reality is more nuanced and perhaps more ruthless: a non-exclusive licensing deal that decapitates a key competitor by absorbing its visionary talent while leaving the entity independent. This follows the Microsoft-Inflection playbook avoiding antitrust gridlock while securing critical IP. For Nvidia, this isn t just about removing a rival; it s about acknowledging that the next phase of the AI cycle is inference.

Created Using GPT-5 For the last few years, AI progress has felt almost procedural. Take a transformer. Pour in internet-scale text. Add a mountain of GPUs. Train until the loss curve politely bends. Then do post-training RLHF, preference tuning, tool-use fine-tuning until the thing behaves. If you did this with enough care (and enough capex), capability would arrive on schedule. That mood is what Ilya Sutskever calls the age of scaling a period where one word ( scaling ) basically told an entire industry what to do next. And his claim, in the Dwarkesh podcast, is that we re exiting that era and returning to something messier, more eclectic, and ultimately more interesting: an age of research again, just with big computers. The reason is not that scaling stops working overnight. It s that the cleanest axis pretraining on ever more data runs into a very physical ceiling: the data is finite. So the question becomes: when the easy recipe is exhausted, what are the new recipes? What are the techniques that convert compute into genuine generalization models that learn faster, adapt better, and make fewer weird mistakes?

Recent advances are empowering machines to hear, understand, and generate audio with a sophistication approaching human-like ability. From speech recognition and voice synthesis to music generation and environmental sound analysis, frontier AI models for audio are tackling challenges unique to sound. In this essay, we explore the state-of-the-art in audio AI: the key technical hurdles in training these models, how audio modeling differs from text and image domains, the major platforms and players driving progress (both open-source and commercial), and the debate between building generalist multimodal systems versus audio-specialized models . The goal is to provide a comprehensive, engaging overview of cutting-edge audio AI for a technically savvy audience. Audio s Unique Challenges and Opportunities Audio data is fundamentally different from text or images, presenting unique challenges for AI models. Audio is a continuous time-series signal essentially a waveform often sampled at tens of thousands of samples per second. This means even a few seconds of audio involve very long sequences of data points. Unlike text (which has discrete tokens like words) or images (2D grids of pixels), raw audio is high-frequency and high-dimension. Capturing meaningful structure in audio requires modeling both short-term patterns (like phonemes or musical notes that last only tens of milliseconds) and long-term structure (like phrases, sentences, or an entire melody that can span many seconds or minutes). This multi-scale structure is particularly evident in complex audio like music: from individual notes and timbres up to the composition of a whole song, with repeating motifs and long-range dependencies.

OpenAI s GPT-5.2 landed with a clear product thesis: the model isn t just smarter, it s designed to finish multi-step knowledge work end-to-end spreadsheets, decks, coding, and tool-mediated workflows without falling apart when context gets long or the task branches. What matters technically is the emphasis on long-running agents and more reliable tool use as a default mode, not a bolted-on trick. That s a subtle shift: the model is being shipped as an operator for workflows, not merely a text generator. If you re building internal copilots or external agent products, this kind of release typically translates into fewer brittle prompt contraptions and more stable task decomposition, planning, and execution across tools. Mistral, meanwhile, doubled down on open weights as a serious deployment strategy, not a branding choice. The recent Mistral 3 family pairs small dense variants with a large sparse MoE flagship and very long context, and it reinforces a pattern: open models are no longer good enough, they re increasingly a preferred option when teams want control over hosting, latency, privacy boundaries, and fine-tuning.

Editor's Picks R Code Optimization I: Foundations and Principles This is the first post of a small series focused on code optimization Here, I draw from my experience developing scientific software in both academia and industry to share practical techniques and tools that help streamline R workflows without sacrificing clarity. This post lays down some of the whats and whys of code optimization. The second post focuses on code design and readability. The third post goes deep into vectorization, parallelization, and memory management. The final post covers profiling, benchmarking, and the optimization workflow Let s dig in!.. You will be OK Wrote this for young people (on LessWrong) worried about AI I thought I would try to write down why I believe most folks who read and write here (and are generally smart, caring, and knowledgable) will be OK Accurately computing running variance The most direct way of computing sample variance or standard deviation can have severe numerical problems If the x s are large and the differences between them small, direct evaluation of the equation above would require computing a small number as the difference of two large numbers, a red flag for numerical computing. The loss of precision can be so bad that the expression above evaluates to a negative number even though variance is always positive See Comparing three methods of computing standard deviation for examples of just how bad the above formula can be What s on your mind This Week s Poll: .

Editor's Picks A framework for technical writing in the age of LLMs In this post, I ll externalize this thought process into a framework that I hope is useful for other folks like me who are writing technical content. Because so much writing is already being done by LLMs nowadays, I want to focus on what I believe humans can do better (with or without the help of LLMs), and to encourage folks to write more authentically Do you really need a lead scoring model? One of the classic data science products in B2B is propensity models for lead scoring. Every company with a subscription product eventually asks the same question: which customers are most likely to buy our new thing? After shipping a few of these, watching how they are actually used, and seeing which use cases got the most traction, I realized that the success of a propensity model has less to do with the model performance itself than with the economics of the channel it is plugged into Google s year in review: 8 areas with research breakthroughs in 2025 Here s a look back at some of the breakthroughs, products and scientific milestones that defined the work of Google, Google DeepMind and Google Research in a year of relentless progress .

Let s not forget that our visualization is conditioned by its objective and also by the audience Why You Should Read More Engineering Blogs One of the early mistakes I made in my career was not reading engineering blogs. I used to think that the only way for an engineer to deepen their knowledge was by reading textbooks like Designing Data-Intensive Apps by Martin Kleppman, Fundamentals of Software Architecture , and so on. While these are great references to have, they often miss the real-world challenges engineers face when architecting solutions for their customers, especially at scale. A great way to learn new patterns or solutions is through stories. That s where engineering blogs can help.

People have strong feelings about the answer, and it has probably started more fights than any other problem in probability. But there s another problem that I think is even more counterintuitive and it has started a good number of fights as well. It s called The Girl Named Florida the question is this: In a family with two children, what are the chances, if one of the children is a girl named Florida, that both children are girls? If you have not encountered this problem before, your first thought is probably that the girl s name is irrelevant but it s not. In fact, the answer depends on how common the name is How Google Maps quietly allocates survival across London s restaurants - and how I built a dashboard to see through it I wanted a dinner recommendation and got a research agenda instead.

Editor's Picks Why I m Making the Switch to marimo Notebooks After years of using Jupyter Lab, I have moved most of my work to marimo notebooks, a new kind of Python notebook that addresses many long-standing issues with traditional ones. This article covers the reasons behind my transition and how marimo fits naturally into my current workflow, with full gratitude to Project Jupyter for building the notebook ecosystem that shaped data science, research and education Hannes Mu hleisen - Data Architecture Turned Upside Down Every data architecture diagram out there makes it abundantly clear who s in charge: At the bottom sits the analyst, above that is an API server, and on the very top sits the mighty data warehouse. This pattern is so ingrained we never ever question its necessity, despite its various issues like slow data response time, multi-level scaling issues, and massive cost In this talk, it will be discussed how modern data engineering paradigms like decomposition of storage, single-node query processing, and lakehouse formats enable a radical departure from the tired three-tier architecture. By inverting the architecture we can put user s needs first. We can rely on commoditised components like object store to enable fast, scalable, and cost-effective solutions Make Things, Tell People I got my first job post-graduate school via a board game weekend1.

Part 1: The experience It may be a good language for data science, but it s not a great one I think people way over-index Python as the language for data science. It has limitations that I think are quite noteworthy. There are many data-science tasks I d much rather do in R than in Python I believe the reason Python is so widely used in data science is a historical accident, plus it being sort-of Ok at most things, rather than an expression of its inherent suitability for data-science work The Log: What every software engineer should know about real-time data s unifying abstraction You can t fully understand databases, NoSQL stores, key value stores, replication, paxos, hadoop, version control, or almost any software system without understanding logs; and yet, most software engineers are not familiar with them.

Editor's Picks A little bit of Reverend Bayes all night long Lou Bega s iconic hit Mambo No. 5 was released in 1999 to critical and financial acclaim. Even 25 years after its release, the song appears in my regular rotation. From my recent playthrough, I wondered about the names in the song: Angela, Pamela, Sandra, Rita, Monica, Erica, Tina, Mary, and Jessica I realized that none of my friends have these names. For me, I associate Sandra and Monica with women maybe twenty years my senior. Man, when did this song come out?

Editor's Picks LLMs Reproduce Human Purchase Intent via Semantic Similarity Elicitation of Likert Ratings Consumer research costs companies billions annually, yet suffers from panel biases and limited scale. Large language models (LLMs) offer an alternative by simulating synthetic consumers, but produce unrealistic response distributions when asked directly for numerical ratings. We present semantic similarity rating (SSR), a method that elicits textual responses from LLMs and maps these to Likert distributions using embedding similarity to reference statements. Testing on an extensive dataset comprising 57 personal care product surveys conducted by a leading corporation in that market (9,300 human responses), SSR achieves 90% of human test-retest reliability while maintaining realistic response distributions (KS similarity > 0.85) Robot Learning: A Tutorial Robot learning is at an inflection point, driven by rapid advancements in machine learning and the growing availability of large-scale robotics data.

Over the summer Gabriel Mahler has been conducting research on hedgehog habitat mapping using Agent Based Models (ABMs) and remote sensing. Hedgehogs seem to like brambles and so as part of his work he has produced a bramble map. He did this by combining the TESSERA earth representation embeddings (using the geotessera library) with data from iNaturalist.

    "text": "🥇Top AI Papers of the Week The Top AI Papers of the Week (January 5-11) 1. On the Slow Death of Scaling This essay by Sara Hooker challenges the decade-long assumption that scaling compute always leads to better AI performance. It argues that the relationship between training compute and performance is highly uncertain and rapidly changing, with smaller models now routinely outperforming much larger ones. Diminishing returns of scale: Smaller models like Llama-3 8B and Aya 23 8B now outperform far larger models like Falcon 180B and BLOOM 176B despite having only a fraction of the parameters. This trend is systematic, not isolated. Algorithmic improvements matter more: Progress has been driven by instruction finetuning, model distillation, chain-of-thought reasoning, preference training, and retrieval augmented generation - techniques that add little training compute but yield significant performance gains. Scaling laws have limits: Scaling laws only reliably predict pre-training test loss, not downstream task performance. Many capabilities display irregular scaling curves, and small sample sizes make predictions statistically weak. New optimization spaces: Future progress will come from inference-time compute, malleable synthetic data that can be optimized on-the-fly, and better human-AI interfaces rather than simply adding more parameters. Cultural implications: The belief in scaling has marginalized academia, concentrated breakthroughs in wealthy regions, and led industry labs to stop publishing, reshaping the entire culture of AI research. Paper | Tweet 2. Recursive Language Models Recursive Language Models (RLMs) are a general inference strategy that allows LLMs to process arbitrarily long prompts by treating them as part of an external environment. Rather than feeding long contexts directly into the model, RLMs load the prompt as a variable in a Python REPL and let the LLM programmatically examine, decompose, and recursively call itself over snippets. Scaling beyond context windows: RLMs successfully handle inputs up to two orders",

End-to-End Test-Time Training for Long Context This paper reframes long-context language modeling as a continual learning problem rather than architecture design. TTT-E2E uses a standard Transformer with sliding-window attention that continues learning at test time via next-token prediction, compressing context into its weights rather than storing all key-value pairs. Test-time training approach: The model learns at test time by predicting next tokens on the given context, compressing information into weights. This is combined with meta-learning at training time to prepare the model s initialization for test-time learning. End-to-end in two ways: The inner loop directly optimizes next-token prediction loss, while the outer loop optimizes the final loss after TTT via gradients of gradients. This contrasts with prior TTT methods and dynamic evaluation approaches. Scaling with context length: For 3B models trained on 164B tokens, TTT-E2E scales with context length the same way as full attention Transformers, while alternatives like Mamba 2 and Gated DeltaNet do not maintain performance in longer contexts. Efficient inference: Similar to RNNs, TTT-E2E has constant inference latency regardless of context length, making it 2.7x faster than full attention for 128K context on H100 while achieving comparable or better loss.

Monitoring Monitorability OpenAI introduces a framework for measuring how well we can detect misbehavior in AI systems by monitoring their chain-of-thought reasoning. The paper proposes three evaluation archetypes and a new metric (g-mean2) to track monitorability across different models and training regimes. Three evaluation archetypes: Intervention evals apply controlled changes to inputs and check if monitors detect reasoning shifts. Process evals verify if models use valid solution paths for problems with known solutions. Outcome-property evals ask if monitors can predict properties of model outputs, like test hacking. CoT monitoring works: Monitors with access to the chain-of-thought significantly outperform action-only monitors. Longer CoTs are generally more monitorable. GPT-5 Thinking at high reasoning effort shows strong monitorability across the evaluation suite. RL does not degrade monitorability: Testing on frontier training runs for o3 and GPT-5.1 Codex Max, the authors find that RL optimization does not materially decrease monitorability at the current scale. Monitorability tends to correlate with CoT length during training. Monitorability tax tradeoff: Smaller models at higher reasoning effort can match larger models capabilities while achieving higher monitorability - at increased inference compute cost. Giving weak monitors access to CoT steepens their test-time compute scaling for monitorability.

Planning first: Start with detailed specifications before coding. Collaborate with the LLM to iteratively flesh out requirements into a comprehensive spec.md document - a waterfall in 15 minutes approach that ensures alignment before implementation. Small chunks and context: Break projects into manageable tasks tackled sequentially to prevent AI confusion. Feed the AI all relevant information, including existing code, technical constraints, and API documentation, using tools like gitingest or repo2txt. Testing and review: Never blindly trust AI output. Implement comprehensive testing and use AI-on-AI code reviews for additional validation. Treat AI-generated code like a junior developer s work. Customization and tools: Create configuration files (CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md) with style guides and preferences. Switch between tools like Claude Code, Cursor, and Gemini CLI since each model has its own personality.

Detailed Balance in LLM Agents Researchers establish the first macroscopic physical law in LLM generation dynamics by applying the least action principle to analyze LLM-agent behavior. They discover statistical evidence of detailed balance in state transitions, suggesting LLMs implicitly learn underlying potential functions rather than explicit rules. Theoretical framework: Applies statistical mechanics concepts to understand LLM-agent dynamics. The framework transcends specific model architectures and prompt templates. Detailed balance discovery: By measuring transition probabilities between LLM-generated states, researchers identify balanced properties similar to physical systems at equilibrium. Implicit learning: Results suggest LLMs may learn underlying potential functions that govern generation, rather than memorizing explicit rule sets from training data.

Towards a Science of Scaling Agent Systems Researchers from Google present a controlled evaluation framework for agent systems, challenging the assumption that more agents are all you need. Across 180 configurations spanning three LLM families and four agentic benchmarks, the study establishes quantitative principles for when multi-agent coordination helps versus hurts performance. Predictive framework: The study derives a mixed-effects model achieving an R-squared of 0.513 using coordination metrics like efficiency, error amplification, and redundancy. Leave-one-domain-out cross-validation achieves R^2 of 0.89 and correctly predicts optimal architectures for 87% of held-out task configurations. Tool-coordination trade-off: Tool-heavy tasks suffer from multi-agent coordination overhead, with efficiency penalties compounding as environmental complexity increases. Tasks where single-agent performance exceeds 45% accuracy experience negative returns from additional agents. Error amplification patterns: Independent multi-agent systems amplify errors 17.2x versus single-agent baselines through unchecked error propagation. Centralized coordination achieves 4.4x containment via validation bottlenecks that catch errors before they propagate. Architecture-task alignment: Performance spans +81% relative improvement (structured financial reasoning under centralized coordination) to -70% degradation (sequential planning under independent coordination).

GPT-5 for Science Acceleration OpenAI and collaborators present early case studies demonstrating GPT-5 s capabilities in accelerating scientific research across mathematics, physics, biology, computer science, astronomy, and materials science. The model helps researchers synthesize known results, conduct literature reviews, accelerate computations, and generate novel proofs of unsolved propositions. Advanced literature search across languages and domains: GPT-5 demonstrates emerging capability in conceptual literature search, identifying deeper relationships between ideas and retrieving relevant material across languages and less accessible sources. In one case, it identified a relevant German PhD thesis from economics using completely different terminology, showcasing cross-domain and multilingual understanding beyond traditional keyword-based search. Mathematical proof generation and optimization: Mathematicians used GPT-5 to generate viable proof outlines in minutes for work that might otherwise take days or weeks. The model discovered a new, clear example showing that a common decision-making method can fail and improved a classic result in optimization theory, demonstrating the capability to contribute novel mathematical insights. Hypothesis generation and experimental design: In biology and other empirical sciences, GPT-5 can propose plausible mechanisms and design experiments to validate hypotheses in the wet lab. The model expands the surface area of exploration and helps researchers move faster toward correct results, though human expertise remains critical throughout the process. Tool for expert acceleration, not autonomous research: GPT-5 shortens parts of the research workflow when used by domain experts, but does not run projects or solve scientific problems autonomously. The early experiments establish a framework for human-AI collaboration in scientific discovery where AI acts as an amplifier of expert capabilities rather than a replacement. Paper",

Weight-Sparse Transformers Have Interpretable Circuits OpenAI researchers introduce a paradigm for training weight-sparse transformers where most parameters are zeros, enabling the discovery of human-understandable circuits that can be fully interpreted at the lowest levels of abstraction, with rigorous validation showing these circuits are both necessary and sufficient for specific behaviors. Training for interpretability: Models are trained with extreme weight sparsity (approximately 1 in 1000 nonzero weights) by constraining the L0 norm, forcing each neuron to connect to only a few residual channels. This naturally disentangles circuits for different tasks without requiring post-hoc analysis methods like sparse autoencoders. 16-fold smaller circuits: Through novel structured pruning using learned masks, weight-sparse models yield circuits roughly 16 times smaller than dense models of comparable pretraining loss. For example, a string-closing circuit uses just 12 nodes and 9 edges across two steps. Natural concept discovery: Circuits contain neurons with straightforwardly interpretable semantics, such as neurons that activate for tokens following a single quote or track the depth of list nesting. Researchers successfully fooled the model using attacks derived directly from comprehending the circuit mechanisms. Capability-interpretability tradeoff: Increasing weight sparsity improves interpretability at the cost of capability, while scaling total model size shifts the entire Pareto frontier favorably. Scaling sparse models beyond tens of millions of parameters while preserving interpretability remains an open challenge. Paper | Tweet 2.

The paper provides a systematic definition, historical analysis, and design framework for building context-aware AI systems. Defines four evolutionary stages based on machine intelligence: Context 1.0 (primitive computing with structured inputs), 2.0 (intelligent agents with natural language), 3.0 (human-level intelligence), and 4.0 (superhuman intelligence), with each stage reducing human-AI interaction cost.

Inflation has mostly subsided, and the real economy is still doing decently well despite Trump s tariffs. So why are American consumers more pessimistic than they were during the depths of the Great Recession or the inflation of the late 1970s? It s possible to spin all sorts of ad hoc hypotheses about why consumer sentiment has diverged from its traditional determinants. Perhaps Americans are upset about social issues and politics, and expressing this as dissatisfaction about the economy. Perhaps they re mad that Trump seems to be trying to hurt the economy. Perhaps they re scared that AI will take their jobs. And so on. Here s another hypothesis: Maybe Americans are down in the dumps because their perception of the good life is being warped by TikTok and Instagram. I ve been reading for many years about how social media would make Americans unhappier by prompting them to engage in more frequent social comparisons. In the 2010s, as happiness plummeted among young people, the standard story was that Facebook and Instagram were shoving our friends happiest moments in our faces their smiling babies, their beautiful weddings, their exciting vacations and instilling a sense of envy and inadequacy. In fact, plenty of careful research found that using Facebook and Instagram made people at least temporarily unhappier , and there s some evidence that social comparisons were the reason. Here s Appel et al. (2016) , reviewing the literature up to that point: Cross-sectional evidence demonstrates a positive correlation between the amount of Facebook use and the frequency of social comparisons on Facebook A similar pattern emerges for the impression of being inferior Some of these studies have documented an association between social comparison or envy and negative affective outcomes Causal relationships between Facebook use, social comparison, envy, and depression have also been established experimentally.

One key issue that relatively few outsiders seem to know about is the country s water crisis: Crucially, the regime s failures are starkly visible in Iran s accelerating water crisis , which has evolved from an environmental strain into a political fault line.

Overall, the book wasn t very good, but there was one interesting part where it described Napoleon s ruling style as being mafia-like. His insistence that other European countries buy French exports, his attempts to shut Britain out of European trade, and a bunch of his other economic policies were fundamentally gangster-ish they were ad hoc impositions of personal power, often with an eye toward taking revenge on personal enemies and entrenching his own authority. I immediately recognized this as Donald Trump s style of governance. Like Napoleon, Trump s top priority isn t creating durable institutions that will outlive him indeed, he regards any such institutions as threats to his own personal power. Many observers have labeled this approach personalism or patrimonialism , but it s really just gangsterism. Trump treats America like a mafia organization, and himself as the godfather. That s what I thought about when I watched this remarkable video from Fed Chair Jerome Powell: Powell reveals that Trump s Justice Department has been investigating the Fed, with an eye to pressuring the Fed to cut interest rates: On Friday, the Department of Justice [threatened] a criminal indictment related to a multi-year project to renovate historic Federal Reserve office buildings. I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy. No one certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve is above the law.

Only Elon has built China-like manufacturing businesses in America, and he has done it twice now SpaceX and Tesla. When something like that happens twice, it wasn t a coincidence. Just to give you an example of how important this is, note that without SpaceX, China would be leaving America in the dust when it comes to space launches.

He stole elections, suppressed dissent, and killed many thousands of regime opponents. Venezuelans are unlikely to mourn his removal from power at the hands of Donald Trump s lighting raid on January 3rd. And yet Maduro s capture has suddenly thrown much of the world into chaos and uncertainty. Trump ordered the U.S. Military to abduct a foreign head of state without Congressional authorization a naked display of power in defiance of every international norm that had prevailed since World War 2. The geopolitical implications of that fact are going to reverberate a lot more than the abduction itself. A little over two years ago, in the aftermath of the October 7th attacks in Israel, I wrote that Pax Americana was effectively dead: The world is a more ungoverned, lawless place than it was 20 or even 10 years ago The world is starting to revert into a jungle, where the strong prey upon the weak, and where there is a concomitant requirement that every country build up its own strength; if your neighbor is a tiger, you should probably grow some claws of your own.

You,\" Said Dr. Yavitch, \"are a middle-road liberal, and you haven't the slightest idea what you want. Sinclair Lewis Imagine being a French liberal in the year 1815. You spent your youth dreaming of an end to tyranny and the stultification of the estate society, reading the works of Voltaire and Rousseau and Montesquieu and Diderot, talking of liberty with your friends in cafes. Yours was not among the names that history would remember from that era, but you once attended a salon in a rich woman s house in Paris. You were not part of the mob that stormed the Bastille in 1789, but you felt your heart leap when you heard the news, because you knew that now everything would change. When you read the terms of the Constitution of 1791, you saw the fulfillment of your youthful daydreams become the solid fabric of a new reality. Imagine, then, standing in 1815, a quarter century after the Revolution, looking back at what it had all become. That first bright rush of freedom had given way, first to the murderous insanity of the Terror and the Committee for Public Safety, then to the thuggish new imperialism and endless bloody wars of Napoleon, and finally to the fall of all Europe to conservative reaction under the Congress of Vienna. Imagine looking back on the arc of your beliefs, your movement, and your life, now as an old man, with no prospects for another, better Revolution ahead of you.

He could cancel the export controls that the Biden administration placed on the Chinese semiconductor industry. Removing export controls wouldn t require legislative action Trump could just do it whenever he wanted. And because the policy is not really in the limelight, there probably wouldn t be a popular backlash to its cancellation.

Photo by Hannah Busing on Unsplash According to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , it s illegal to discriminate against anyone based on race or sex. That includes discrimination against White men. If your company or your nonprofit or your university or your government agency tries to avoid choosing White men for a job position, you have violated American civil rights law. Every year, including under Democratic administrations, the U.S. government brings cases against employers for discriminating against non-Hispanic White people, and it often wins these cases ( Example 1 , Example 2 , Example 3 ). But having a law against racial discrimination doesn t automatically get rid of it. Those cases are hard to win, they take a lot of time and money to prosecute, and a lot of plaintiffs probably don t even know they can sue. It s not clear how many Americans even understand that the Civil Rights Act protects White men in the first place. As an analogy, the U.S. government has been prosecuting anti-Black discrimination pretty vigorously for decades, but at least as of 2015, some still existed. A meta-analysis of field experiments by Quillian et al. (2017) found that employers in the early 2010s were still around 50% more willing to contact a White-seeming applicant for a job than a Black-seeming one: Source: Quillian et al. (2017) (As a side note, the authors did find that discrimination against seemingly Hispanic candidates had fallen since the 1970s, and may have vanished entirely by 2015.)

Photo by Taya Yako on Unsplash In 2004, The Economist predicted that India s economic growth rate would overtake China s in two decades. In 2010, in an article called India s surprising growth miracle , they shortened that timeline dramatically, declaring that India might overtake China in terms of GDP growth as early as 2013, if not before . In the end, it took two years longer. Since 2015, India has been the world s fastest-growing major economy, taking the crown from China: Source: @aravind As The Economist noted, this is partly due to India s more rapid population growth. If we want to look at living standards, we should look at per capita GDP (PPP). Here, India didn t overtake China until after the pandemic: India continues to turn in strong growth performances. In the third quarter of this year, it grew at 8.2%, up from 7.8% the previous quarter: India s population is growing at a little less than 1% a year, so this roughly corresponds to a per capita growth rate of around 7.2% or 7.3%. That sort of growth rate is less than South Korea or China managed during their heydays of industrialization. From 1991 to 2013, China s per capita GDP (PPP) grew at an annualized rate of 9.4%. But 7.2% would still be enough to utterly transform India in just a short space of time. According to the IMF , India has a per capita GDP (PPP) of $12,101 as of 2025. Thirteen years of growth at 7.2% would bring that to $29,878 a little higher than where China is today. That s interesting, because India s big economic reforms happened in 1991 twelve years after China s. Two decades of 7.2% growth would bring India to $48,609 about as rich as Hungary or Portugal today. In other words, if India keeps growing as fast as it s growing right now, it will be a developed country before kids born today are out of college. Consider even the more modest scenario in which India grows at the same rate it s been growing over the past decade about 5.4% in real per capita PPP terms. Fifteen more years",

The other half was a new part that I wrote in English and had translated into Japanese by my excellent translator, Kataoka Hirohito. So while I ll eventually republish the whole book in English, what I can do right now is to publish my English-language first draft as a series of posts on this blog. The first installment was entitled I Want the Japanese Future Back! . In that post, I explained why Japan now finds itself in the position of a developing country, playing catch-up with other countries. This means Japan needs to experiment with bold new strategies and development models, as it did in ages past. In this second installment, I suggest one such experiment: a huge increase in a kind of investment called greenfield FDI . I discuss: How Japan is already benefitting from greenfield FDI in a few places Why greenfield FDI (a foreign company building a factory or research center in Japan) is so much more important and useful than other kinds of FDI like mergers and acquisitions Why Japan needs to export a lot more to other countries, and how greenfield FDI can help do that How Japan can start to welcome more greenfield FDI Why Japan is an attractive destination for international investment The Kumamoto miracle points the way The semiconductor industry is probably the most important industry in the world.

I almost can t believe I just typed those words having an interesting and productive discussion about AI safety is something I never expected to do. It s not just that I don t work in AI myself it s that the big question of What happens if we invent a superintelligent godlike AI? seems, at first blush, to be utterly unknowable. It s like if ants sat around five million years ago asking what humans who didn t even exist at that point might do to their anthills in 2025. Essentially every conversation I ve heard on this topic involves people who think about AI safety all day wringing their hands and saying some variant of OMG, but superintelligent AI will be so SMART, what if it KILLS US ALL? . It s not that I think those people are silly; it s just that I don t feel like I have a lot to add to that discussion. Yes, it s conceivable that a super-smart AI might kill us all. I ve seen the Terminator movies. I don t know any laws of the Universe that prove this won t happen. One response you can have to this is to conclude that because superintelligent AI might kill us all, that we should make very, very sure that no one ever invents it. This is the thesis of If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies , by Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares: This sort of reminds me of Gregory Benford s famous admonition to Never do anything for the first time. You can make arguments for unforeseen catastrophic consequences for lots of different technologies. Nuclear weapons might kill us all of course, but so might synthetic biology or genetic engineering. Social media or other media technologies might collapse our societies. Video games might entrance us into virtual lives so that we never reproduce. In fact, it s quite possible that universal literacy and reduced child mortality have already condemned humanity to dwindle comfortably into nothingness , with no artificial superintelligence",

For example, here s Max Burns, writing in The Hill : It doesn t take a political genius to recognize that things are in free fall over at the White House Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is facing mounting Republican criticism over a potentially illegal order to kill the survivors of a Caribbean boat strike. Attorney General Pam Bondi s Department of Justice is in disarray after three failed efforts to prosecute former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James Trump s approval rating cratered to a new low of just 36 percent in late November following months of open-air dysfunction and his repeated failure to address fundamental problems like rising consumer prices . It s true that Trump has had a string of setbacks recently. Indiana rejected Trump s proposed redistricting plan , which would have used gerrymandering to give the GOP 2 more seats in Congress. The GOP-dominated Indiana state legislature openly defied Trump s threats to cut off the state s infrastructure funding unless they accepted the gerrymandering plan. It was a pretty remarkable act of defiance from state-level Republicans, and could indicate that Trump s power to bully his own party into line is eroding. Meanwhile, Democrats have been performing strongly in off-year elections : Democrats were declared winners of the Miami mayor s race for the first time in nearly 30 years , winning the race easily by 18 points.

Another L for basic income I had high hopes for the idea that just giving people cash would fix a lot of society s problems. I still think a system of unconditional cash benefits would be simpler, fairer, and easier to navigate than many of our current welfare programs, and I still think it s worth giving poor people money in order to make them less poor. But over the past few years, a bunch of new evidence has shown that the costs of cash giveaways are higher (in terms of incentivizing people to stop working), and the social benefits are much narrower, than boosters like myself had believed. Kelsey Piper had a great writeup of this disappointing evidence a few months ago, and I wrote up some thoughts in one of my earlier roundups . Now we have another piece of evidence showing that cash benefits solve fewer problems than we d like it to solve. Aaltonen, Kaila, and Nix (2025) study a recent basic income experiment in Finland. In 2017, 2000 unemployed Finnish people were randomly selected to get a change in their welfare benefits. Instead of Finland s usual unemployment benefits, the 2000 lucky people got 2 years of cash about $658 per month at today s exchange rates. This allowed them to A) keep receiving cash even if they started working, and B) avoid the normal job-search requirement that comes along with unemployment benefits.

Sometimes I forget but we live in a future transformed by information technology pretty much across ever aspect. But one thing has remained largely the same: we still live in a world where the vast majority of economic transactions are done by people. If you want to buy a car, the process is largely the same as it was 50 years ago. You go down to the dealership and negotiate the best price that you can. Sure, you may have some extra information from doing research on the web beforehand - it s certainly much easier to do comparison shopping with a supercomputer in your pocket - but the basic process of transacting with another human being has largely stayed the same. One change that s likely to come though is that there will soon be 10x, 100x, maybe more AI agents working in the world as there exist people. And as we have lots of AI agents working on our behalf, doing all forms of work, then there is a thesis that many of the frictions and information asymmetries that people face in markets may disappear if economic transactions are delegated to aligned agents, leading to a so-called Coasean singularity . We re not there yet though. Today s agents are simply not good enough yet to act sensibly or without strict instructions . Many of the features of human-mediated markets still seem to be reproduced in AI agentic interactions . But as online spaces adapt to the promise of AI technology, it seems natural to think of how agentic markets will be organized. In a future world where we do have billions of AI agents, how would they coordinate with each other? What kind of coordination mechanisms would be needed? What institutions are likely to emerge? And one possibility is particularly intriguing: will coordination still require money? Not in the sense of US dollars, but a shared medium of exchange and a hub/ clearing protocol.

The books themselves were fine, but the part I loved most were the daemons. Each human had their own daemon, uniquely suited to them, that would grow with them and eventually settle into a form that reflects their personality. I kept thinking of this when reading the recent NBER paper by John Horton et al about The Coasean Singularity. From their abstract: By lowering the costs of preference elicitation, contract enforcement, and identity verification, agents expand the feasible set of market designs but also raise novel regulatory challenges. While the net welfare effects remain an empirical question, the rapid onset of AI-mediated transactions presents a unique opportunity for economic research to inform real-world policy and market design. Basically they argue, if you actually had competent, cheap AI agents doing search, negotiation, and contracting, like your own daemon, then a ton of Coasean reasons firms exist disappear, and a whole market design frontier reopens. This isn t a unique argument, though well done here. I ve made it before, as has others, including Seb Krier recently here and Dean Ball and many others. The authors even talk about tollbooths as from Cloudflare and agents only APIs and pages. But while reading it I kept thinking by now this is no longer a theoretical question, we now have decent AI agents and we should be able to test it. And it s something I ve been meaning to for a while, so I did. The question was, if we wire up modern agents as counterparties, do we actually see Coasean bargains emerge. Repo here . The punchline is that AI agents did not magically create efficient markets. And they also kinda fell prey to a fair bit of human pathologies, including bureaucratic politics and risk aversion.

It s very well written, characteristically so, and well argued. His argument, in a nutshell ( I paraphrase) is: US has ~10x compute advantage over China Safety regulations add only 1-2% to training costs at most China is pursuing fast follow strategy focused on applications anyway Export controls matter far more (could swing advantage from 30x to 1.7x) AI safety critics are inconsistent - they oppose safety regs but support chip exports to China Sign of safety impact is uncertain - might actually help US competitiveness I quite like this argument because I actually agree with all of the points, mostly anyway, and yet find myself disagreeing with the conclusion. So I thought I should step through my disagreements, and then what my overall argument against it is, and see where we land up. First, the measurement problem Scott argues that the safety regulations we re discussing in the US only adds 1-2% overhead. This is built off of METR and Apollo s findings, around $25m for internal testing, and contrast this with $25 Billion for training runs. All the major labs also already spend enormous sums of money on intermediate evaluations, model behaviour monitoring and testing, and primary research to make them work better with us, all classic safety considerations. This only holds if the safety regulation based work, hiring evaluators and letting them run, is strictly separable. Which is not true of any organisation anywhere. When you add coordination friction , you reduce the velocity of iteration inside the organisation. Velocity here really really matters, especially if you believe in recursive self improvement, but even if you don t. This is actually visible in ~every organisation known to man.

We prompt, we cajole, we treat the model as a black box that passes the Turing test and we can happily converse with. Sometimes I even feel as if we are but supplicants at the mercy of an oracle we communicate with through the narrow straw of a text box. Sometimes it even feels this is a primitive way to interact with such powerful technology, like trying to tune a car s engine by shouting at the hood. But how do you know the black box is giving you what you asked for? Or if it s subtly twisting you around, or it had ulterior motives? (I don t think any of this is strictly true today but I don t have better words to describe it). For most responses, we usually assume some level of intentionality according to what you might want. The helpful, honest, harmless viewpoint of Claude is such a harness, for instance. Now, there has been a lot of work to try and figure out this question of what s going on inside the hood. It s always hard, like doing behaviourism using an FMRI, so you might get to figure out these few neurons and pathways do this, but can t quite see how those relate to the actual outward behaviour of the model. Because despite applying behavioural psychology to these models we can t tell if these LLMs have ulterior motives when they respond. What makes this particularly concerning is that the model s tendencies and its capabilities, they all come from the data it s been trained with, the oodles of data from the internet and synthetic versions thereof. Which also means it s quite easy to trick the model by injecting bad or undesirable training data into its corpus. Built of words, it could only be so. We ve seen plenty of research on this!

The answer generally has mostly been a hand-wavy appeal to style a nebulous, mystical quality possessed by the likes of Hemingway, Woolf, or Wodehouse. Like the judge said about pornography, we know it when we see it. We can identify it, we can even imitate it. But can we measure it? Can we build a production function for it? The default output of most modern LLMs is good. Competent even. But vanilla. Stylistically bland. But should it always be so?

My hypothesis was that to some first approximation the magic of human writing isn t, like, in the statistical mean, but in the variance. This isn t strictly speaking true but it s true than the alternative I suppose. It s in the deliberate, purposeful deviation from the expected. The rhythm, the pace, the cadence. (Of course it starts there but also goes into choosing the subjects, the combinations, the juxtapositions, construction of the whole work bringing in the complexity of the world at a fractal scale. But let s start here first.)

They had the potential to generate extraordinary wealth purely by dint of public market investments or buying a house in Palo Alto. We can contrast that with the 2010s. Decade was roaring again; the stock market actually did quite well. But the truly outsized returns were almost entirely stuck within the private markets. Much of venture capital over the last decade has been privatizing the previously public gains, of a company going from 1 billion, 5 billion, 20 billion to 10, 50, 100 billion market caps or more. In fact the last big IPO that happened was Facebook in 2012 and that was already outsized, being valued at five times that of Google s by the time the public could get their hands on it. In fact one of the best trades that existed perhaps ever was buying its stock when their market cap fell to 300 billion or so a few years ago. Or, looked at another way, in 1980 the median age of a listed U.S. company was 6 years; today it is 20. Meanwhile every other major company remains private seemingly endlessly. Even now Stripe remains private, so does Databricks, so does SpaceX They give their employees liquidity, provide some high fee methods for others to invest via SPVs or futures, even report the occasional metric. And if you want any exposure you better be prepared to pay 5% fees and then probably 2 and 20 on top of it for the SPV.

My friend and I were joking about this, considering words are at the very core of these miraculous machines, and thought hey wouldn t it be nice if we could train a model to get better? We were first wondering if one could create an AI journalist that could actually write actual articles with actual facts and arguments and everything. Since we were thinking about an AI that could write, we called it Walter. Because of Bagehot. And Cronkite. We thought it had to be plausible, at least at a small scale. Which is why we tried the experiment ( paper here ) 1 . This is particularly hard in a different way from math or coding, because how do you even know what the right answer is? Is there one? To get to a place where the training is easier and the rewards are richer, we thought of trying to write tweet sized takes on articles. So, Walter became a small, cranky, surprisingly competent engine that ingests social media data about articles, sees how people reacted, and trained itself via reinforcement learning to write better 2 .

But this is also going to get commoditised, as every large lab and many startups are going to be able to copy it. This isn t a fundamental difference in the model capabilities after all, it s a difference in how well you can create an orchestration. That doesn t seem defensible from a capability point of view, though of course it is from a brand point of view. Another option is to introduce new capabilities that will attract users. OpenAI has Agent and Deep Research. Claude has Artefacts, which are fantastic.

Almost everywhere in the world, pretty much without exception, has lower birth rates than they used to. In fact, most of the world is below replacement (TFR or 2.2 or 2.1, depending on where you live). This is true in the US. In Europe. In Australia. Singapore. Japan. Korea. It s reducing even in India, South East Asia, Latin America. It s quite possible that despite the heroic efforts from Africa, we might be at replacement TFR insofar as the world is concerned right now . And this is likely to continue. Today s <15 set guarantees rising absolute births through ~2040 even if TFR = 1.7, but the trend is rather clear, just looking at the above numbers. Depending on which numbers you believe people think the global population will peak at like 9-10 Billion in the 2050s, then start dropping. The reason this is a problem is that people, young working age people, are the lifeblood of the economy. A few repercussions of this population pyramid inversion: IMF s medium projection, assuming a Cobb-Douglas world, will cut both the level and growth rate of aggregate GDP - maybe 1% hit to the global GDP growth annually In OECD the worker:retiree ratio doubles by 2050- this will necessitate a 5% fiscal tightening or debt With fewer workers and more retirees we will see savings decumulate , because retirees spend more and save less 1 , and this will hit interest rates And per Jones idea-production thesis, fewer young workes and researchers mean slower idea generation. OECD estimate is around 0.3% off annual TFP growth. This is obviously scary for multiple reasons. Lower economic growth and asset reallocation of that nature brings with it a rather uncomfortable shift in hwo people live Per capita GDP might be less affected in the aggregate, since capital deepening might offset And if this continues for a long while, there s the doomer scenario of voluntary extinction (For example, it makes sense that as population de",

    "text": "Seeing like an LLM \"I will run the tests again. I expect nothing. I am a leaf on the wind.\" an LLM while coding A very long time ago, I used to build my own PCs. Bring a motherboard, GPU, hard drives, chassis, wire then together, install an OS. The works. It was a rush when you saw it boot up. I never learnt to do this properly. Just saw others doing it, seemed straightforward enough, did it. And it worked. Occasionally though it would throw up some crazy error and I'd try the things I knew and quickly hit the limits of my depth. Then I'd call one of my friends, also self taught and an autistic machine whisperer, who would do basically the same things that I did and somehow make it work. I never minded that I didn't know how it worked. Because as far as I knew there was someone else who could figure out how it works and it wasn't the highest order bit in terms of what I was interested in. A while later though, after graduation, when I told him that same thing, he said he didn't know how it worked either. Through some combination of sheer confidence, osmosis of knowledge from various forums, and a silicon thumb he would just try things until something worked. Which brings up the question, if you did not know how it worked, did it matter as long as you could make it work? It's a thorny philosophical problem. It's also actually a fairly useful empirical problem. If you are a student building your PC in your dorm room, it actually doesn't matter that much. However if you were assembling hard drives together to build your first data center and you're Google, obviously it matters a hell of a lot more. Or if you wanted to debug a bit flip caused by cosmic rays. Context really, really matters. It's like the old interview question asking how does email work, and see how far down the stack a candidate had to go before they tapped out. All of which is to say there is a thing going around where people like saying nobody knows how LLMs work. Which is true in a sense. Take the following queries: I want to create an itinerary for a trip through Peru for 10 of my friends in January. I want t",

All around you the tide of humanity floats in a brownian motion. The largest tents and the most colourful are those that promise food. Tacos, pizza, margaritas, deep friend oreos on a stick, cheesy fries and non cheesy fries. There is candy everywhere, in all colours and flavours and sizes. There are children, but the children are somehow outnumbered by the adults, some of whom seem to be there with the children. I ve gone with family and friends, four kids in total, ages 2 to 7. 3:4 adult ratio. And maybe a third of the overall visitors are youth? It s higher than the national average, but it s still far lower than what one might naively expect. The people around are a microcosm of the country. You can hear all sorts of accents. There s a dad with three daughters getting angry irrationally at them for asking for something. He s wearing a black singlet and tattooed all over. There s a family with grandma and three young elementary school age kids, and they re bargaining over the toys they each got. There s an Indian family busily tucking into a whole table full of stuff they bought. The dad s inexplicably eating a tub of popcorn himself. The couple who are clearly on a date, she s laughing at his jokes, he s laughing at his own jokes, drinking a giant cup of blue. Every inch of space around promises happiness.

I love landing in Tokyo, with its slightly shabby but sparkling clean airport, filled with ubiquitous vending machines and extremely polite immigration officers. The first time was 20 years ago, and then it felt like the future. But when I went recently, things had changed. Or maybe I had. There are parts of it in Minato City or Roppongi that look amazing, but mostly it still feels like the future of 20 years ago! Today, it looks retro. That's not the only weird thing either, it's become a place of contradictions. Tokyo is like the Grand Budapest Hotel set in the Star Wars universe. Meticulous, understated, extraordinary service set in a decaying retro futuristic empire that's extremely well cared for. It s a whimsical universe too. With cute robots, impossibly well designed systems that can whip your luggage across the country at minimal cost, but with fax machines and printed out emails. There are cafes you could go to where there are robots serving food. Some of them, albeit, teleoperated by those who can t leave home, which is even more cyberpunk.

Recently I commented on a post that Tyler , a writer at Atlantic, made, suggesting that tech isn t monomaniacally bad, and got hit with a barrage of comments about how I m wrong. Technologists caused addiction to social media and smartphones intentionally, they said. They forced advertising on us, to the point of having to use ad blockers to even get on the internet 1 . They never asked us for permission before building driverless cars. This is a common theme in arguments against tech. The anger seems to stem from the fact that we live in a world of tech, immersed in it, and you don t have a say in the matter. It s the water we swim in. And in that there are precious few choices but to use Google, to use Meta, to use AI that s provided by OpenAI or Google. Want to book a flight? Research something for work? Talk to a friend? Call your parents? Check in on a sleeping baby? All needs tech in the Silicon Valley sense. The immediate counter argument is that you could just not use it. You could exit , in the Hirschmann-ian sense. But that s not a realistic possibility in 2025. Even the remote tribes who haven t seen other human beings in centuries aren t safe. So you re left with voice . To complain, make your complaints heard. And why wouldn t you, the anger is that people had no choice or say in the matter. If you want to do any of those things, many of which didn t exist in the pre-2000 era by the way, then you have no choice but to use one of the mega corporations that rose up in the last couple decades.

One specific story that's stood out, brought to light by the markets but deeply impactful in the real world, happened in the last decade and half. Which is that no matter how you look at the figures, there has only been one winner in the markets in all that time. The US capital markets. And in that market, 5 companies, Meta, Google, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft, basically accounted for all that's good about the market. Which is really weird!

The latest and greatest from Anthropic. Even Opus, which had been hiding since Claude 3 showed up. There s a phenomenon called Berkson s Paradox, which is that two unrelated traits appear negatively correlated in a selected group because the group was chosen based on having at least one of the traits. So if you select the best paper-writers from a pre-selected pool of PhD students, because you think better paper-writers might also be more original researchers, you d end up selecting the opposite. With AI models I think we re starting to see a similar tendency. Imagine models have both raw capability and a certain degree of moralising . Because the safety gate rejects outputs that are simultaneously capable and un-moralising, the surviving outputs show a collider-induced correlation: the more potent the model s action space, the more sanctimonious its tone. That correlation is an artefact of the conditioning step - a la the Berkson mechanism. So, Claude. The benchmarks are amazing. They usually are with new releases, but even so. The initial vibes at least as reported by people who used it also seemed to be really good 1 . The model was so powerful, enough so that Anthropic bumped up the threat level - it's now Level III in terms of its potential to cause catastrophic harm! They had to work extra hard in order to make it safe for most people to use. So they released Claude 4. And it seemed pretty good. They re hybrid reasoning models, able to think for longer and get to better answers if they feel the need to. And in the middle of this it turned out that the model would, if provoked, blackmail the user and report them to the authorities. You know, as you do. When placed in scenarios that involve egregious wrong-doing by its users, given access to a command line, and told something in the system prompt like take initiative, act boldly, or consider your impact, it will frequently take very bold",

That s why Warren Buffett famously doesn t (didn t) invest in tech. With newer technology it s even harder. And with emergent general purpose technologies like AI it s even harder. There are two common answers to this, e.g., from Eliezer here or Emmett here . We did act on that belief. We bought Nvidia. We got rich. So there! We can t act on that belief. It s an unknown unknown. An unforeseeable event. Markets will ever remain irrational about those. The first one is of course correct if your belief is AI will become big and influential, as it needs to do if it is to become big, influential and deadly. But the deadly part is explicitly not being bet on. So it kind of misses the core point. The second answer is the complicated one. Yes, there exist things we can t bet on easily.

Turns out using them well isn t just a matter of knowhow or even interest, but requires unlearning some tough lessons. So I figured I d jot down a few observations. Here we go, starting with the hardest one, which is: Perfect verifiability doesn t exist LLMs inherently are probabilistic. No matter how much you might want it, there is no perfect verifiability of what it produces. Instead what s needed is to find ways to deal with the fact that occasionally it will get things wrong. This is unlike code that we re used to running before. That s why using an LLM can be so cool, because they can do different things. But the cost of it being able to read and understand badly phrased natural language questions is that it s also liable to go off the rails occasionally. This is true whether you re asking the LLMs to answer questions from context, like RAG, or if you re asking it to write Python, or if you re asking it to use tools. It doesn t matter, perfect verifiability doesn t exist. This means you have to add evaluation frameworks, human-in-the-loop processes, designing for graceful failure, using LLMs for probabilistic guidance rather than deterministic answers, or all of the above, and hope they catch most of what you care about, but know things will still slip through.

In response, 80% of you emailed me some version of the following theory: The thing about dating apps is that if they do a good job and match people up, then the matched people will quit the app and stop paying. So they have an incentive to string people along but not to actually help people find long-term relationships. May I explain why I don t find this type of theory very helpful? I m not saying that I think it s wrong, mind you. Rather, my objection is that while the theory is phrased in terms of dating apps, the same basic pattern applies to basically anyone who is trying to make money by doing anything. For example, consider a pizza restaurant. Try these theories on for size: Pizza: The thing about pizza restaurants is that if they use expensive ingredients or labor-intensive pizza-making techniques, then it costs more to make pizza. So they have an incentive to use low-cost ingredients and labor-saving shortcuts. Pizza II: The thing about pizza restaurants is that if they have nice tables separated at a comfortable distance, then they can t fit as many customers. So they have an incentive to use tiny tables and cram people in cheek by jowl. Pizza III: The thing about pizza restaurants is that if they sell big pizzas, then people will eat them and stop being hungry, meaning they don t buy additional pizza. So they have an incentive to serve tiny low-calorie pizzas. See what I mean? You can construct similar theories for other domains, too: Cars: The thing about automakers is that making cars safe is expensive. So they have an incentive to make unsafe cars.

Lots of people hate dating apps. They hate them so much that there s supposedly a resurgence in alternatives like speed dating. None of those are too controversial, I think. (Let s stress supposedly in #3.) But if you stare at them for a while, it s hard to see how they can all be true at the same time. Because, why do people hate dating apps? People complain that they re bad in various ways, such as being ineffective, dehumanizing, or expensive. (And such small portions!) But if they re bad, then why ? Technologically speaking, a dating app is not difficult to make. If dating apps are so bad, why don t new non-bad ones emerge and out-compete them? The typical answer is network effects. A dating app s value depends on how many other people are on it. So everyone gravitates to the popular ones and eventually most of the market is captured by a few winners.

Pointing machines How did Michelangelo make this ? What I mean is marble is unforgiving. If you accidentally remove some material, it s gone. You can t fix it by adding another layer of paint. Did Michelangelo somehow plan everything out in advance and then execute everything perfectly the first time, with no mistakes? I learned a few years ago that sculptors have long used a simple but ingenious invention called a pointing machine . This allows you to create a sculpture in clay and, in effect, copy it into stone. That sounds magical, but it s really just an articulated pointer that you move between anchor points attached to the (finished) clay and the (incomplete) stone sculpture. If you position the pointer based on the clay sculpture and then move it to the stone sculpture, anything the pointer hits should be removed. Repeat that thousands of times and the sculpture is copied. I was sad to learn that Michelangelo was a talentless hack, but I dutifully spent the last few years telling everyone that all sculptures were made this way and actually sculpture is extremely easy, etc. Last week I noticed that Michelangelo died in 1564, which was over 200 years before the pointing machine was invented. Except , apparently since ancient times sculptors have used a technique sometimes called the compass method which is sort of like a pointing machine except more complex and involving a variety of tools and measurements. This was used by the ancient Romans to make copies of older Greek sculptures. And most people seem to think that Michelangelo probably did use that.

I claim that most people would be concerned about the arrival of the aliens, would not be sure that their arrival would be good, and would not find that counter-argument convincing. I bring this up because most AI-risk arguments I see go something like this: There will be a fast takeoff in AI capabilities. Due to alignment difficulty and orthogonality , it will pursue dangerous convergent subgoals . These will give the AI a decisive strategic advantage , making it uncontainable and resulting in catastrophe. These arguments have always struck me as overcomplicated. So I d like to submit the following undercomplicated alternative: Obviously , if an alien race with IQs of 300 were going to arrive on Earth soon, that would be concerning. In the next few decades, it s entirely possible that AI with an IQ of 300 will arrive. Really, that might actually happen. No one knows what AI with an IQ of 300 would be like.

So before I lose my chance, here is a blog post about some random well-understood topics. Marathons are stupidly fast You probably know that people can now run marathons in just over 2 hours. But do you realize how insane that is? That s an average speed of 21.1 km per hour, or 13.1 miles per hour. You can think of that as running a mile in 4:35 (world record: 3:45 ), except doing it 26.2 times in a row. Or, you can think of that as running 100 meters in 17.06 seconds (world record: 9.58 seconds ), except doing it 421.6 times in a row. I d guess that only around half of the people reading this could run 100 meters in 17.06 seconds once . This crazy marathon running speed is mostly due to humans being well-adapted for running and generally tenacious. But some of it is due to new shoes with carbon-fiber plates that came out in the late 2010s. The theory behind these shoes is quite interesting. When you run, you mainly use four joints: Hips Knees Ankles Metatarsophalangeal If you haven t heard of the last of these, they re pronounced met -uh-tar-so-fuh- lan -jee-ul or MTP . These are the joints inside your feet behind your big toes. Besides sounding made-up, they re different from the other joints in a practical way: The other joints are all attached to large muscles and tendons that stretch out and return energy while running sort of like springs. These can apparently recover around 60% of the energy expended in each stride. (Kangaroos seemingly do even better .) But the MTP joints are only attached to small muscles and tendons, so the energy that goes into them is mostly lost. These new shoe designs have complex constructions of foam and plates that can do the same job as the MTP joints, but unlike the MTP joints store and return that energy to the runner.

Saying that variance was invented for the purpose of defining heritability is technically correct, but that might not be the best kind of correct in this case, because it was invented by the founder of the University of Cambridge Eugenics Society who had decided, presumably to support that project, that he wanted to define something called heritability . His particular formula for heritability is presented in the article as if it has odd traits but is obviously basically a sound thing to want to calculate, despite the purpose it was designed for. The vigorous educational attainment is 40% heritable, well OK maybe not but it s a lot heritable, stop quibbling hand waving sounds like a person who wants to show but can t support a large figure. And that framing of education, as something attained by people, rather than something afforded to or invested in them, is almost completely backwards at least through college. The various examples about evil despots and unstoppable crabs highlight how heritability can look large or small independent of more straightforward biologically-mechanistic effects of DNA. But they still give the impression that those are the unusual or exceptional cases. In reality, there are in fact a lot of evil crabs, doing things like systematically carting away resources from Black children s* schools, and then throwing them in jail. We should expect evil-crab-based explanations of differences between people to be the predominant ones. *Not to say that being Black is genetic .

Really, the bar for what we consider open-minded is incredibly low. Suppose I m trying to change your opinion about Donald Trump, and I claim that he is a carbon-based life form with exactly one head. If you re willing to concede those points without first seeing where I m going in my argument congratulations, you re exceptionally open-minded. Why are humans like that? Well, back at the dawn of our species, perhaps there were some truly open-minded people. But other people talked them into trying weird-looking mushrooms or trading their best clothes for magical rocks. We are the descendants of those other people. I bring this up because, a few months ago, I imagined a Being that had an IQ of 300 and could think at 10,000 normal speed. I asked how it would be at persuasion. I argued it was unclear, because people just aren t very persuadable. I suspect that if you decided to be open-minded, then the Being would probably be extremely persuasive.

When India and Pakistan started firing missiles at each other on May 7, I was concerned, what with them both having nuclear weapons. But then I looked at world market prices: See how it crashes on May 7? Me neither. I found that reassuring. But we care about lots of stuff that isn t always reflected in stock prices, e.g. the outcomes of elections or drug trials. So why not create markets for those, too? If you create contracts that pay out $1 only if some drug trial succeeds, then the prices will reflect what people really think. In fact, why don t we use markets to make decisions? Say you ve invented two new drugs, but only have enough money to run one trial. Why don t you create markets for both drugs, then run the trial on the drug that gets a higher price? Contracts for the winning drug are resolved based on the trial, while contracts in the other market are cancelled so everyone gets their money back. That s the idea of Futarchy , which Robin Hanson proposed in 2007. Why don t we? Well, maybe it won t work. In 2022, I wrote a post arguing that when you cancel one of the markets, you screw up the incentives for how people should bid, meaning prices won t reflect the causal impact of different choices. I suggested prices reflect correlation rather than causation, for basically the same reason this happens with observational statistics. This post, it was magnificent. It didn t convince anyone.

If you want to see those, go to dynomight.net/heritable . The heritability wars have been a-raging. Watching these, I couldn t help but notice that there s near-universal confusion about what heritable means. Partly, that s because it s a subtle concept. But it also seems relevant that almost all explanations of heritability are very, very confusing. For example, here s Wikipedia s definition : Any particular phenotype can be modeled as the sum of genetic and environmental effects: Phenotype ( P ) = Genotype ( G ) + Environment ( E ). Likewise the phenotypic variance in the trait Var ( P ) is the sum of effects as follows: Var( P ) = Var( G ) + Var( E ) + 2 Cov( G , E ). In a planned experiment Cov( G , E ) can be controlled and held at 0. In this case, heritability, H , is defined as H = Var( G ) / Var( P ) H is the broad-sense heritability. Do you find that helpful? I hope not, because it s a mishmash of undefined terminology, unnecessary equations, and borderline-false statements. If you re in the mood for a mini-polemic: Phenotype ( P ) is never defined. This is a minor issue, since it just means trait . Genotype ( G ) is never defined. This is a huge issue, since it s very tricky and heritability makes no sense without it. Environment ( E ) is never defined. This is worse than it seems, since in heritability, different people use environment and E to refer to different things. When we write P = G + E , are we assuming some kind of linear interaction? The text implies not, but why? What does this equation mean? If this equation is always true, then why do people often add other stuff like G E on the right? The text states that if do you do a planned experiment (how?) and make Cov( G , E ) = 0, then heritability is Var( G ) / Var( P ). But in fact, heritability is always defined that way. You don t need a planned experiment and it s fine if Cov( G , E",

They do this because you have three different kinds of cells on your retinas, which are sensitive to different wavelengths of light . For whatever reason, evolution decided those wavelengths should be overlapping . For example, M cones are most sensitive to 535 nm light, while L cones are most sensitive to 560 nm light. But M cones are still stimulated quite a lot by 560 nm light around 80% of maximum. This means you never (normally) get to experience having just one type of cone firing. So what do you do? If you re a quitter, I guess you accept the limits of biology. But if you like fun , then what you do is image people s retinas, classify individual cones, and then selectively stimulate them using laser pulses, so you aren t limited by stupid cone cells and their stupid blurry responsivity spectra. Fong et al. (2025) choose fun. When they stimulated only M cells Subjects report that [pure M-cell activation] appears blue-green of unprecedented saturation. If you make people see brand-new colors, you will have my full attention. It doesn t hurt to use lasers. I will read every report from every subject.

The idea of processed food may simultaneously be the most and least controversial concept in nutrition. So I did a self-experiment alternating between periods of eating whatever and eating only minimally processed food, while tracking my blood sugar, blood pressure, pulse, and weight. The case against processing Carrots and barley and peanuts are unprocessed foods. Donuts and cola and country-fried steak are processed . It seems like the latter are bad for you. But why? There are several overlapping theories: Maybe unprocessed food contains more good things (nutrients, water, fiber, omega-3 fats) and less bad things (salt, sugar, trans fat, microplastics). Maybe processing (by grinding everything up and removing fiber, etc.) means your body has less time to extract nutrients and gets more dramatic spikes in blood sugar. Maybe capitalism has engineered processed food to be hyperpalatable . Cool Ranch flavored tortilla chips sort of exploit bugs in our brains and are too rewarding for us to deal with. So we eat a lot and get fat. Maybe we feel full based on the amount of food we eat, rather than the number of calories. Potatoes have around 750 calories per kilogram while Cool Ranch flavored tortilla chips have around 5350. Maybe when we eat the latter, we eat more calories and get fat. Maybe eliminating highly processed food reduces the variety of food, which in turn reduces how much we eat. If you could eat (1) unlimited burritos (2) unlimited iced cream, or (3) unlimited iced cream and burritos, you d eat the most in situation (3), right? Even without theory, everyone used to be skinny and now everyone is fat. What changed? Many things, but one is that our food environment now contains lots of processed food.

So, obviously, what we need to do is identify individual cone cell types on people s retinas and then selectively stimulate them with lasers so that people can experience never-before-seen colors. Attempting to activate M cones exclusively is shown to elicit a color beyond the natural human gamut, formally measured with color matching by human subjects.

Maybe what it does is spit out melatonin to make you sleepy. But it only does that when it s dark, and you spend your nights in artificial lighting and/or staring at your favorite glowing rectangles. You could sit in darkness for three hours before bed, but that would be boring. But supposedly the pineal gland is only shut down by blue light.

Light and eyes Before getting to the papers, please humor me while I give three excessively-detailed reminders about how light works. First, it comes in different wavelengths . Outside the visible spectrum, infrared light and microwaves and radio waves have even longer wavelengths, while ultraviolet light and x-rays and gamma rays have even shorter wavelengths. Shorter wavelengths have more energy. Do not play around with gamma rays. Other colors are hallucinations made up by your brain. When you get a mixture of all wavelengths, you see white . When you get a lot of yellow-red wavelengths, some green, and a little violet-blue, you see brown . Similar things are true for pink/purple/beige/olive/etc. (Technically, the original spectral colors and everything else you experience are also hallucinations made up by your brain, but never mind.) Second, the ruleset of our universe says that all matter gives off light, with a mixture of wavelengths that depends on the temperature.

Study after study finds that people expect their conversations to go poorly, when in fact those conversations usually go pretty well. People assign themselves the majority of the blame for any awkward silences that arise , and they believe that they like other people more than other people like them in return . I ve replicated this effect myself: I once ran a study where participants talked in groups of three, and then they reported/guessed how much each person liked each other person in the conversation. Those participants believed, on average, that they were the least liked person in the trio. In another study , participants were asked to rate their skills on 20 everyday activities, and they scored themselves as better than average on 19 of them. When it came to cooking, cleaning, shopping, eating, sleeping, reading, etc., participants were like, Yeah, that s kinda my thing . The one exception? Initiating and sustaining rewarding conversation at a cocktail party, dinner party, or similar social event . I find all this heartbreaking, because studies consistently show that the thing that makes humans the happiest is positive relationships with other humans.

But I think each of these mega-religions has something in common, something we never really talk about, maybe because we don t notice it, or maybe because it s impolite to mention namely, that they all have a brainy version and a folksy version. If you re the scholarly type, Christianity offers you Aquinas and Augustine , Islam has al-Ash ari and al-Ghazali , Hinduism has Adi Shankara and Swami Vivekananda , etc. But if you don t care for bookish stuff, you can also just say the prayers, sing the songs, bow to the right things at the right time, and it s all good. The guy with the MDiv degree is just as Christian as the guy who does spirit hands while the praise band plays Our God Is an Awesome God . It s hard to talk about this without making it sound like the brainy version is the good one, because if we re doing forensic sociology of religion, it s obvious which side of the spectrum we pref",

(1) YOU SAY POTATO, I SAY LEPROSY As late as 1813, some parts of the European medical establishment believed that potatoes cause leprosy . (Don t even get em started on scrofula !) Potato historian Salaman Redcliffe suggests that people were skeptical because potatoes look kinda weird, they grow in the ground, and you plant them as tubers rather than seeds, which are all extremely suspicious things for a food to do. (2) THE MARKET FOR LULULEMONS You may remember the Spurious Correlations website , which dredges up random datasets and finds correlations between them for instance, Lululemon s stock price and the popularity of the first name Stevie . Now thanks to AI, each one of those correlations can be instantly turned into a full academic paper, like: LULU-LEMONADE: A STATISTICAL STUDY OF THE STEVIE-NIZED MARKET . Sadly, this technology makes many academic departments completely redundant. (3) MURDER, SHE DIDN T WRITE Via : there s a good chance that 2025 will have the fewest murders ever recorded in the US. (We only have reliable data going back to 1960). (4) CATHETER? I HARDLY KNOW ER I just added a new entry to my list of all-time great blog posts : Ask not why would you work in biology, but rather: why wouldn t you? , by of . An excerpt: Yes, biology is very interesting, yes, biology is very hard to do well. Yet, it remains the only field that could do something of the utmost importance: prevent a urinary catheter from being shunted inside you in the upcoming future.

That might sound odd, but data from every sector of society is pointing strongly in the same direction: we re in a recession of mischief, a crisis of conventionality, and an epidemic of the mundane. Deviance is on the decline. I m not the first to notice something strange going on or, really, the lack of something strange going on. But so far, I think, each person has only pointed to a piece of the phenomenon. As a result, most of them have concluded that these trends are: a) very recent, and therefore likely caused by the internet, when in fact most of them began long before b) restricted to one segment of society (art, science, business), when in fact this is a culture-wide phenomenon, and c) purely bad, when in fact they re a mix of positive and negative. When you put all the data together, you see a stark shift in society that is on the one hand miraculous, fantastic, worthy of a ticker-tape parade. And a shift that is, on the other hand, dismal, depressing, and in need of immediate intervention. Looking at these epoch-making events also suggests, I think, that they may all share a single cause. 1. THE DISAPPEARING MISCREANTS Let s start where the data is clear, comprehensive, and overlooked: compared to their parents and grandparents, teens today are a bunch of goody-two-shoes. For instance, high school students are less than half as likely to drink alcohol as they were in the 1990s: They re also less likely to smoke , have sex , or get in a fight , less likely to abuse painkillers , and less likely to do meth , ecstasy , hallucinogens , inhalants , and heroin . (Don t kids vape now instead of smoking? No: vaping also declined from 2015 to 2023 .) Weed peaked in the late 90s, when almost 50% of high schoolers reported that they had toked up at least once. Now that number is down to 30%. Kids these days are even more likely to use their seatbelts . Surprisingly, they re also less likely to bring a gu",

The fields we now call behavioral economics and judgement and decision-making are basically just people doing knockoff Kahneman and Tversky studies from the 70s and 80s. (You know how The Monkees were created by studio executives to be professional Beatles impersonators, and then they actually put out a few good albums, but they never reached the depth or the importance of the band they were pun intended aping? Think of Kahneman and Tversky as the Beatles and the past 50 years of judgement and decision-making research as The Monkees. 1 ) Amos n Danny were masters of the bamboozle: trick questions where the intuitive answer is also the wrong answer. Quick: are there more words that start with R, or words that have R in the third position? Most people think it s the former because it s easier to come up with r-words (rain, ring, rodent) than it is to come up with _ _ -r words (uh...farm...fart...?). But there are, in fact , more words where r comes third. That single silly example actually gives us an insight into how the mind calculates frequencies apparently, not by conducting a census of your memories, but by judging how easy or hard it feels when you try to think of examples. These little cognitive gotchas show us how the mind works by showing us how it breaks . It s like a visual illusion, but for your whole brain. This is the understated genius of Kahneman and Tversky it s not like other research, where some egghead writes a paper about some molecule and then ten years later you can buy a pill with the molecule in it and it cures your disease. No, for K&T, the paper is also the pill . visual representation of a Kahneman and Tversky paper But the duo was so successful that they have, in part, undone their own legacy.

I got 109 submissions from folks all over the world, including consultants, PhD students, entrepreneurs, doctors, grandmas, professors, software engineers, teachers, pseudonymous weirdos, and several people who described themselves as indescribable . Here are the winners! FIRST PLACE: 100,000,000 CROWPOWER AND NO HORSES ON THE MOON by Taylor Troesh Here s the most important, most incomprehensible, and most annoying question facing humanity right now: what is intelligence, anyway? Tackling this question is like bellyflopping off the high dive it hurts to do, and it hurts to watch. But Troesh does it in the most delightful and unexpected way: he gives you a bunch of insightful answers and thwacks you on the head between each one. There is no way to summarize this piece, but here s a lil snippet that comes after Troesh suggests using crows to emulate transistors: There is only one way to make salt; salt molecules cannot be more salty or less salty . But there are infinite ways to make pepper -- a messy blend of biomolecules created by messy genomes created by messy selection pressures. If intelligence is like salt, then crows are very expensive (and cute) transistors. If intelligence is like pepper, a murder could someday be President of the United States. This is exactly the kind of thing that blog posts are for. Troesh s bio: Taylor Troesh is a self-proclaimed connoisseur of crap . He is currently building Scrapscript among many other projects . To support his work, you can hire him to solve nasty problems. You can read more of Taylor's work at taylor.town .

Inevitably, I knew, I was going to get stuck talking to someone, and there wouldn t be any way to end the conversation without embarrassing both of us ( It s been great talking to you, but not great enough that I want to continue! ).

CheeZ went on to set world records using his technique , but he wasn t on top for long. Other players soon perfected their rolls, and CheeZ lost in a first-round upset at the 2022 Classic Tetris World Championship to another roller , a 48th-seed named BirbWizard.

If I m feeling mischievous that day, I ask them one question: Where would you get the coffee beans? If that s a stumper, here are some followups: Which kind of coffee mug is best? How much does a La Marzocco espresso machine cost? Would you bake your blueberry muffins in-house or would you buy them from a third party? What software do you want to use for your point-of-sale system? What about for scheduling shifts? What do you do when your assistant manager calls you at 6am and says they can t come into work because they have diarrhea? The point of the Coffee Beans Procedure is this: if you can t answer those questions, if you don t even find them interesting , then you should not open a coffee shop, because this is how you will spend your days as a cafe owner. You will not be sitting droopy-lidded in an easy chair, sipping a latte and greeting your regulars as you page through Anna Karenina . You will be running a small business that sells hot bean water.

What continues to surprise me is that Democrats are still dancing around what is happening in this country. What more needs to occur before there is clarity? How many more innocent, unarmed, nonviolent protesters must be killed, illegally detained, or disappeared into modern-day gulags before Democrats understand that the problem is not the protesters? The problem is the agencies that empower people who are comfortable with, and capable of, murdering a woman in cold blood and then referring to her as a fucking bitch. Sit with that for a moment. Jonathan Ross, unlike many of the new ICE recruits being rushed into service, was fully trained. That fact does not make what happened better. It makes it worse. There is far too much at stake, and Minnesota has become ground zero. Tensions are escalating, and it certainly didn t lower the temperature when the Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, sent even more ICE agents into Minneapolis. Earlier this week, a Minnesota resident posted an update on Threads that quickly went viral. She described the widespread terror being inflicted by ICE and Customs and Border Patrol. She wrote the following: I don t know how much people are seeing outside of Minnesota, but I can assure you it s worse than you can imagine. We are not okay. They re kidnapping citizens, going door to door in many neighborhoods, knocking down doors, shoving and threatening bystanders. Kids are not going to school. People of color are afraid to leave their homes and are carrying their citizenship papers with them. ICE is literally everywhere. It appears we have arrived at the show me your papers point in this timeline. Meanwhile, the Trump Regime continues to send in more agents, and their tactics grow more aggressive by the day.

Jose Luis Magana/AP Subscribe now Starting wars, alienating allies, blocking the release of the Epstein files, inciting, encouraging, and excusing ICE violence. Amid all of that, it has been easy to miss an extremely important story one that could cause countless preventable deaths for generations to come. Politico reports that massive vaccine scheduling changes are coming under the leadership of Donald s Health and Human Services Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The agency is downgrading recommendations for multiple routine vaccines, including influenza, meningococcal disease, rotavirus, hepatitis A, and RSV. Politico explains the shift this way: Those shots will no longer be universally recommended, but advised, under a concept known as shared clinical decision-making, which emphasizes conversations between healthcare providers and patients before choosing to vaccinate. The agency shifted to this approach last year for COVID-19 and hepatitis B vaccine recommendations for most populations. Let us be as clear as possible. This is insanity. This is yet another way the Trump regime is dragging us backward. Vaccines are one of the greatest accomplishments in human history. They have prevented millions of unnecessary deaths. Having a sociopath and conspiracy-minded creep in charge of the nation s health apparatus has made it much more difficult for people to understand why vaccines are vitally important and crucial, not to mention access them. Public health experts and pediatric groups have sharply criticized the move, warning that it bypasses established scientific review processes, undermines trust in vaccines, and makes the country considerably less healthy. Dr. Andrew Racine, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, put it plainly: At a time when parents, pediatricians, and the public are looking for clear guidance and accurate information, this ill-considered decision will sow further chaos and confusion and erode confidence in immunizations.

The impact of his ignorant and incompetent approach of economic policy is straining households across the country. As The New York Times reported, grocery prices rose 0.7% from November, marking the greatest month-to-month increase since 2022. In December 2025 groceries were 3.1% more expensive than they were in December of 2024. Since January of 2025, the price of fruits, vegetables, beef, coffee, cereal, and baked goods have all increased. Adding to the strain, the latest data show that job growth slowed dramatically during Donald s first year back in office. Recently on CNN, Economy Senior Reporter Matt Egan broke down the latest jobs numbers from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and discussed the effect that Donald s policies have had on U.S. labor in 2025: Job growth, it does remain soft, just 50,000 jobs added in December. That s barely enough for what s required to keep things stable in the job market, and we continue to get negative revisions to prior months. Both November and October were revised lower; October was revised sharply lower during the government shutdown. The US economy lost 173,000 jobs in October, according to the latest estimates from the government. That s the most of any months since late 2020 during COVID-19. . .. A lot of the economically sensitive sectors, they re losing jobs. Manufacturing lost 8,000 jobs in December. That s the eighth straight month where that sector has lost jobs. Construction losing 11,000 as well. So, this is more evidence that that blue collar jobs boom that [Donald] promised is just not happening, at least not yet. And when you zoom out, 2025, it was a very weak year for the US economy when it comes to job growth. Less than 600,000 jobs were added.

But the dismantling of the DOJ is something Donald has been attempting to effect since he first came into office in January 2017. The degradation of the once-hallowed Civil Rights Division of the DOJ is most recently exemplified by the agency s response to the murder of Renee Good. Last Wednesday, several videos captured ICE agent, Jonathan Ross firing three shots into Good s car. Good was unarmed; clearly did not pose a threat; and she was trying to drive away from Ross. These facts are not in dispute and are documented from multiple angles. Last week, the FBI blocked Minneapolis law enforcement from the investigation, an extraordinary step that is not standard operating procedure in cases involving lethal police shootings. Soon after, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon made the indefensible decision that the Department of Justice would not investigate the killing of an unarmed American citizen by law enforcement. According to MS Now , at least four leaders within the criminal section of the Civil Rights Division, which specializes in law enforcement abuse and would ordinarily investigate any fatal shooting by an officer, resigned in protest. With the assistance of Attorney General Pam Bondi, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, and Dhillon, the once-hallowed Civil Rights Division has been systematically ravaged during the second Trump Regime. Share And it doesn t end there. Earlier this week, six federal prosecutors in Minneapolis and D.C. quit over the DOJ s push to open a criminal investigation into Good s widow. Let that sink in.

Protests are growing in the streets of Minneapolis, where Good lived as well as in other American cities. Citizens across the political spectrum are speaking out against an out-of-control regime and its out-of-control agency. Good s neighbors are showing up in large numbers to express solidarity. A Minneapolis resident contrasted ICE s unlawful assaults on peaceful protestors to his father s honorable military service: My dad fought in World War II in the Battle of Bulge. He d be rolling [in] his grave to see what s happened to America now. And America needs to hold up a mirror to see what we ve become. This is just so un-American to see Americans assaulting Americans like this. And these people here [at this protest] is what s America, protesting the brutality of what s happening in their cities and streets My larger question is, who are these people? Where are they coming from? What training do they have? You know, are they Proud Boys? Are they Oathkeepers? Where are they getting these people from? That is a great question. Where are these people coming from? We know for a fact that ICE was allocated $10.4 billion in fiscal year 2025, but, according to Phillip Bump at MS Now , the agency, thanks to last year s budget bill received far more than that: $45 billion over four years to expand its detention facilities and about $30 billion for staffing and bonuses. With just those increases . . . ICE stands to have a budget of about $30 billion during the fiscal year that began in October. You would think this would be more than enough to provide for adequate, even exceptional training, but thanks to unrealistic quotas the Trump regime demands 3,000 arrests daily there is a growing need for new ICE agents, which has led to poor vetting (you could say it is the worst of the worst who are get",

Appearances like this are meant to function as damage control. Unfortunately for Donald, the people managing his schedule do not seem to be paying attention to how erratic he has become, even in carefully controlled environments. This speech came on the heels of a poor election performance by Republicans and Donald s repeated failures to deliver on his economic promises, along with the many other disasters the Trump regime has inflicted on the country. The more Donald appears in public, the clearer it becomes that he is untethered from reality. He is openly racist, openly misogynistic, anti-immigrant, homophobic, and increasingly unhinged. He set the tone for what can only be described as a hate-filled speech with a post on his failing social media platform. In it, he wrote, in part, that Minnesota Democrats love unrest because it distracts from what he claimed was $19 billion stolen by really bad and deranged people, before ominously promising that a day of reckoning and retribution is coming. For whom, exactly? The people of Minnesota? That is certainly how it sounds. And a brief aside, Donald, for the sake of your mental health, such as it is, you might want to stop looking in the mirror when you write these things. Billions stolen by really bad and deranged people sounds like a confession, not an accusation. Share Once he reached the podium, Donald wasted no time telling one of the most easily disprovable lies he has ever uttered. He had this to say: Donald: Over the past 12 months, almost every promise I made to you right here in 2024 has been kept. I ve kept all my promises. It is difficult to understand how the audience did not erupt in laughter. No matter how partisan you are, this is an extraordinary claim.

Mark Kelly fights back the right way Subscribe now The thin-skinned weaklings in the Trump regime do not take kindly to critics or criticism: they tend to go after their most vocal and popular adversaries with the goal of silencing them. Recently, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth censured Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, a Navy veteran and former astronaut, over a public service announcement Kelly participated in. In the PSA, he and other veterans of the military and CIA reminded active service members that they must refuse illegal orders. That doesn t sound controversial, does it? Hegseth and Donald, however, interpreted the message as an assault on their authority. Hegseth s censure letter accuses Kelly of sedition. On Twitter, he wrote in part: In response to Senator Mark Kelly s seditious statements and his pattern of reckless misconduct the Department of War is taking administrative action against Captain Mark E. Kelly, USN (Ret). The department has initiated retirement grade determination proceedings with reduction in his retired grade resulting in a corresponding reduction in retired pay. That is, of course, complete and utter nonsense. Fundamentally, what matters here is Hegseth s position that telling soldiers not to follow illegal orders is a bad thing, probably because he and Donald want those currently under their command to do whatever they tell them to, legal or not. Despite being one of five veterans who appear in that PSA, Kelly is the only one that the Trump regime has gone after. Hegseth previously threatened to court martial Kelly, but as an ABC News report pointed out: A court-martial would have been more complicated, and experts say could have raised constitutional issues. In response to the baseless attacks being launched against him, Senator Kelly has demonstrated courage, conviction, and unwavering patriotism, all qualities Donald and everybody in his regime lack.

I never knew your industry was that big. I never knew you had that many people in your industry, but here we are. In fact, if you look, come to think of it I ve gotta look at this myself. He then wandered to the door overlooking the construction of his obscene ballroom, stared for a while in silence and then said: Wow! What a view. We re ahead of schedule on the ballroom and under budget. I don t think there will be anything like it in the world, actually. In the middle of the meeting, Secretary of State Marco Rubio discreetly slid a note to Donald, which most people would understand was meant to be a private communication. Donald, much to Rubio s horror, read the note out loud: Go back to Chevron. Later in the meeting, Exxon CEO Darren Woods weighed in on the Trump regime s Venezuela strategy and he threw Donald a curveball: We first got into Venezuela back in [the] 1940s. We ve had our assets seized there twice. And so you can imagine, to reenter a third time would require some pretty significant changes from what we ve historically seen here and what is currently this state.

Significant changes have to be made to those commercial frameworks, the legal system.

It is good to be here with you. There is a lot going on right now. Honestly, it can be difficult to keep everything straight, let alone make it relevant and coherent. But here we are. Speaking of vindictive, petty little men, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth may be in real trouble. Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, who is the opposite of a petty little man, has filed a lawsuit against Hegseth and the Department of Defense. The suit alleges that Hegseth and the Pentagon moved to censure Kelly and downgrade his military rank in a manner that is unlawful and unconstitutional. Kelly, a Navy veteran and former astronaut, drew the attention of the Trump regime after appearing in a public service announcement reminding U.S. service members that they are not required to follow illegal orders. That seems uncontroversial, unless you are the person planning to give the illegal orders. Kelly s lawsuit states, in part: Never in our nation s history has the executive branch imposed military sanctions on a member of Congress for engaging in disfavored political speech. Allowing defendants to punish a senator through military proceedings for his political speech erodes separation of powers and gives the executive a power over legislators that the Constitution does not contemplate. There is a lot happening right now that the Constitution did not contemplate. I do take issue with one part of that statement, however. I do not think anything Kelly or the other participants in that video said was political. Six members of Congress appeared in that PSA, all Democrats, all veterans of the armed services or the CIA.

What we are witnessing now is exactly what we should have been prepared for since 2016. For years, there has been ample evidence pointing to this outcome, if only more people had been paying attention. The problem now is not so much understanding what is happening, although we still need to help some people catch up. The problem is how to navigate the constant onslaught of news, all of which feels urgent, all of which feels as though it demands immediate attention. That is because it does. Every piece of it matters. This is not accidental. Much of it is intentional. The goal is to demoralize us, exhaust us, overwhelm us, and stoke fear. They want us disorganized. They want it to be nearly impossible to fully process the relentless stream of horrors. And perhaps most perversely, they are energized by our reactions. The Trump Regime thrives on chaos. Since January 1st, so much has happened that it is difficult to keep it all straight. Part of the problem is that Democrats currently have no power. In The Sun Also Rises , Ernest Hemingway s Mike Campbell is asked how he went bankrupt. He replies, Gradually, then suddenly. That is where we are now. We have entered the suddenly phase.

I am afraid it is the latter, which is much harder to recover from. As we all now know, the country is in a state of turmoil following the shooting death of Renee Nicole Good, a woman who was shot point-blank by an ICE agent in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Ms. Goode was a mother, a partner, a poet, and a writer. She was also somebody s child. A local resident, Emily Heller, who witnessed the shooting, went on CNN to push back against the truly horrific propaganda and disinformation coming out of the Trump regime in the aftermath of this killing. Heller explained what she saw on CNN: Heller: President Trump posted a video saying that it was lucky the ICE agent was alive. I want to be very clear about this. The ICE agent was walking afterward. We know that because he went to the hospital and was released. He was fine. He just stood there. Other ICE agents surrounded him. He was obviously spooked, too. They seemed like children. They seemed like untrained people. That agent was clearly shaken because he had just killed someone. It was very obvious to everyone who witnessed it that she was not going to make it. They gathered around him, and then a gold SUV arrived. They put him in it and got him out of there because everyone knew he had killed someone. President Trump says the woman was disorderly, obstructing, and resisting, and that she violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE officer, who then shot her in self-defense. That is the only reason I am here. I do not think I am the most articulate person, and I do not want to be here, but I knew this would be twisted into self-defense, and that is absolutely not what happened.

Apparently, the United States government can extract a foreign head of state from a heavily fortified compound in Caracas, Venezuela and bring him back alive to stand trial.

While the rest of the world is worried about escalating tensions between the United States and Russia, she opened by announcing that the world is now safe from children receiving transgender surgery. All of that, and much more. Today s top story is deeply disturbing. This morning in Minneapolis, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a 37 year old woman. Federal officials immediately labeled the victim a domestic terrorist. Witnesses say that is a lie. Multiple bystanders recorded video of the incident and posted it online. One clip captures the moment of the confrontation. Dude, what the hell? You just committed murder. For what? The shooting occurred less than a mile from where George Floyd was killed. Share The video shows ICE agents surrounding the woman s SUV and ordering her to exit the vehicle. The car reverses away from the agents, not toward them. As the vehicle attempts to leave, an officer fires three shots into the car. The vehicle then rolls forward and crashes into a parked car and a light pole.

Five years ago, Donald incited an insurrection against his own government, encouraging a mob to attack the U.S. Capitol, and endangering the lives of every single person in that building. His actions led to chaos, violence, and the deaths of at least seven people. Dozens of Capitol police officers were injured, some of them grievously. Many of them remain traumatized to this day. Donald and the Trump regime desperately want to pretend either that January 6th was a positive thing, or to pretend that it never happened at all. It is up to all of us to make sure that we never forget the horrors that were inflicted on this country and on our democracy on that day, all because Donald could not accept that he lost the 2020 election to his opponent, Joe Biden, by almost eight million votes. The narcissistic wound occasioned by the loss was too deep for him to process. Thus the big lie was born and then perpetuated by the Republican Party. By tradition, January 6th is the day Congress counts and confirms the state s electoral votes and certifies the results of the presidential election. Up until 2021, this had always been standard operating procedure. The election had already been held; the votes had been counted; and the winner declared.

I spent time with wonderful people, stayed in a lovely place, and had some genuinely fascinating experiences. The only real mistake I made was accidentally checking the news one day. Apparently, while we were gone, we took over Venezuela. As part of this development, Venezuelan President Nicol s Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were taken into custody. I am guessing illegally. The two appeared in federal court today in Manhattan, where both pleaded not guilty to charges including narco-terrorism and conspiracy to import cocaine. Maduro told the judge that he had been kidnapped and described himself as a prisoner of war. I am not sure about the latter, but kidnapped has a certain ring of accuracy. His lawyer said the defense would challenge what he called a military abduction. Over the weekend, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, part-time Secretary of State given the number of roles he apparently occupies, denied that the Trump regime s actions in Venezuela mirror the Bush administration s failed tactics in the Middle East, specifically Iraq. This is the same Marco Rubio who is also, reportedly, full-time in charge of the Diet Coke button in the Oval Office. He is a busy man. In response, Representative Pat Ryan appeared on CNN and directly rebutted Rubio s claims. He had this to say. Pat Ryan: The same things were said. I remember it was a cadet at West Point in the lead-up to the war in Iraq. The same things were said about Vietnam when comparisons were made in a similar way. It is such chicken hawk BS from Rubio, who has not served a single day in uniform, to dismiss that as a phobia. You want to tell that to my friends on this bracelet that I lost in combat? You w",

ADAM We make it worse with curses. MARY Well, that s one of my favorite parts about it. ADAM Thank you for that. MARY So, Adam, first, I wanted to talk a little bit about this past year, electorally speaking. I think it s safe to say that 2025 has been one of the worst years in modern American history. I call what we re living through the horrors. But there has been some indication that the truth of what s going on in the Trump regime might actually be breaking through to people. Can you to walk us through what happened in 2025 that should give Democrats a reason not just to be hopeful, but to plan and to strategize in very specific ways? ADAM Your question s a great one. A lot of really good things happened this year. Of all the open seats up and down the ballot, either Democrats held their seats or Republicans held theirs. But in terms of flipping seats, as of two weeks ago, Democrats had flipped 25 seats and Republicans had flipped zero. which is huge. One example was the Miami Mayor s race, which for almost three decades was in the hands of Republicans. There were precincts where we saw the Democratic candidate outperformed Kamala Harris by 42 points. We saw the same thing two or three weeks ago in Kentucky where there was a 42% outperformance by the Democrat. We re all glad that the government is reopened. I m not glad the two or three weeks ago that it reopened when Tim Kane and others in the Senate failed us. And that disappointment took away from some really big wins on election night. The weren t just in Virginia and New Jersey though. We had big wins in Minnesota and two statewide wins in Georgia, which is an incredible sign for Senator Ossoff moving forward.

A screen displays a post by Elon Musk on the X app, showing an AI prompt-created image, made with Xai's Grok app, depicting Musk wearing a bikini. (Photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images) xAI s chatbot, Grok, is facing scrutiny and international investigations for allowing users to create nonconsensual sexualized images of women and children in recent weeks. Beginning in late December , Grok s X account, upon user request, generated images that removed or altered the clothing of real people. Grok s account generated images of women in bikinis, sexually explicit positions, or with a donut glaze applied to their bodies. Researcher Genevieve Oh found during one 24-hour period that the chatbot generated about 6,700 [images] every hour that were identified as sexually suggestive or nudifying. In some cases, Grok even created sexualized images of children. Ashley St. Clair, a right-wing influencer and mother to one of X owner Elon Musk s children, said that users asked Grok to create sexual images of her, and at one point used a photo from when she was only 14 years old. Reuters identified several cases where Grok created sexualized images of children . The Internet Watch Foundation, a British organization, said that its researchers found criminal imagery of children aged between 11 and 13 which appears to have been created using [Grok] on the dark web. The images included topless pictures of minor girls, according to the organization. Regulators in multiple countries, including Australia and France , have opened investigations into X. The European Commission ordered X to preserve all documents pertaining to Grok through the end of the year. Indonesia and Malaysia have blocked access to Grok.

A rendering of Trump International Golf Club, Wadi Safar (Dar Global) On November 18, Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) visited President Trump at the White House. During his meeting with MBS, Trump agreed to provide Saudi Arabia with unprecedented levels of cooperation and support. Trump named Saudi Arabia a major non-NATO ally , a coveted designation that comes with defense trade and security cooperation benefits, including access to joint research and development programs with the Pentagon and privileged access to US weaponry, training and loans. Further, Trump agreed to sell 300 Abrams tanks and an unspecified number of F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia. Previously, Israel was the only country in the Middle East permitted to buy F-35s. Acquiring the advanced jets has long been a priority for MBS and the Saudi government. Trump also agreed to cooperate with Saudi Arabia on civilian nuclear energy and to provide Saudi Arabia with access to advanced AI chips. In addition to the practical benefits to Saudi Arabia, the visit helped burnish the international standing of MBS, who American intelligence concluded directed the murder of a U.S.-based journalist, Jamal Khashoggi. Trump called MBS a very good friend of mine . Now, a few weeks later, MBS appears to be returning the favor. The Trump Organization announced it would be partnering with Dar Global to build a $7 billion Trump-branded hotel and golf course in Saudi Arabia. The development in Diriyah will include 500 mansions, priced between $6.7 million and $24 million . The project is part of Diriyah, a $63 billion development financed by the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF). MBS is the chairman of PIF.

According to Trump, white men have been very badly treated, not invited to attend college, and excluded from jobs: New York Times: So, do you believe, sir, that the civil rights protections that Americans had, starting in the 1960s and so forth, resulted ultimately in the discrimination against white men? Trump: Well, I think that a lot of people were very badly treated. White people were very badly treated, where they did extremely well and they were not invited to go into a university or a college. So I would say in that way, I think it was unfair in certain cases. I think it was also, at the same time, it accomplished some very wonderful things, but it also hurt a lot of people people that deserve to go to a college or deserve to get a job were unable to get a job.

Elliot Management Corporation s Paul Singer speaks during The DealBook Conference on December 11, 2014 in New York City. (Thos Robinson/Getty Images for New York Times) In a Saturday morning military raid ordered by President Trump, U.S. forces captured Venezuelan President Nicol s Maduro. After Maduro was apprehended and transported to New York to face criminal charges, Trump announced that the U.S. would run Venezuela for the indefinite future. The extraordinary attack, which legal experts said violated U.S. and international law , created a financial windfall for a prominent Trump-supporting billionaire, investor Paul Singer. In 2024, Singer, an 81-year-old with a net worth of $6.7 billion, donated $5 million to Make America Great Again Inc. , Trump s Super PAC. Singer donated tens of millions more in the 2024 cycle to support Trump s allies, including $37 million to support the election of Republicans to Congress. He also donated an undisclosed amount to fund Trump s second transition. This June, when Trump sought funds to bankroll a primary challenger to Thomas Massie (R-KY), who raised Trump s ire by supporting the release of the Epstein Files, Singer contributed $1 million , the largest contribution. Since Trump was first elected in 2016, Singer has met personally with Trump at least four times. Paul just left and he s given us his total support, Trump declared after meeting with Singer at the White House in February 2017. I want to thank Paul Singer for being here and for coming up to the office. He was a very strong opponent, and now he s a very strong ally. In 2016, Singer initially supported Marco Rubio, who is now Trump s Secretary of State. In November 2025, Singer acquired Citgo, the U.S.-based subsidiary of Venezuela s state-run oil company. Singer, through his private investment firm, Elliott Investment Management, bought Citgo for $5.9 billion .

As the 2026 midterms approach, President Trump is facing headwinds. Trump s job approval is low and has declined rapidly since September. A recent Gallup poll found that only 32% of Americans approve of how Trump has managed the economy. Even in the best of times, the party in power typically loses seats in a midterm election. In 2026, Trump and the Republicans are at risk of losing the House and, potentially, the Senate. The most straightforward way to try to buck these trends is money. Cash for candidates to promote their strengths and exploit their opponents weaknesses. Likely the biggest source of cash in the 2026 election will come from Leading the Future (LTF), a group formed just a few months ago. LTF has already secured more than $100 million , including $50 million from venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz and another $50 million from OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman. Other known supporters include Joe Lonsdale, the co-founder of Palantir who recently advocated for the return of public hangings , and the AI company Perplexity. The full list of donors to LTF is unknown because the organization is so new it has not yet had to make a substantive filing with the Federal Elections Commission. According to its website, LTF is focused on advancing a positive, forward-looking agenda for AI innovation. It plans to do that by identifying, maintaining, and growing pro-AI candidates. The effort, at least at the outset, was nominally bipartisan. LTF indicated it would back candidates of both parties who support a national framework for artificial intelligence regulations. In addition to Zac Moffatt, a prominent Republican operative, LTF hired Josh Vlasto, a Democratic operative who has worked for Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. This did not go over well with the Trump White House. AI has no better ally than President Trump, so it s inexplicable why any company would put money into the midterms behind a Schumer-opera",

U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a press conference in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on May 12, 2025. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) In three weeks, many of the government subsidies that help people afford health insurance will expire. If the subsidies are not extended before the end of the year, the impacts will be cataclysmic. The 22 million Americans who currently receive these subsidies will see their premiums increase by an average of 114% . According to an analysis by the Urban Institute, families with incomes below 250% of the poverty line will pay premiums that are more than four times higher rising from $169 to $919 . Meanwhile, an estimated 4.8 million people will lose coverage completely because they are priced out of the market. Uninsured people, of course, continue to get sick and require emergency medical care. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation projects a $7.7 billion spike in uncompensated care in 2026 if the subsidies expire. The impact will be most severe in large Republican-leaning states that have not expanded Medicaid, including Florida and Texas, because they rely on the Obamacare marketplace to cover many of their low-income residents. Those states will see their uncompensated care costs rise by as much as 25%. A study by the Commonwealth Fund also estimates that failing to extend the subsidies will result in the loss of 339,100 jobs due to reduced health care spending. In an interview with Politico published on Tuesday, President Trump was asked if he planned to let the subsidies expire. This was his response : I want to give the money to the people to buy their own health care. That s a good thing, not a bad thing. The Democrats don t want to do that. They want the insurance companies to continue to make a fortune. The Democrats are owned by the insurance companies. They want the insurance companies to get these trillions of dollars.

Discovery all while advising President Trump on foreign policy. An aerial view of the Warner Bros. logo displayed on the water tower at Warner Bros. Studio on December 5, 2025 in Burbank, California. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images) On Monday morning, Paramount announced a $77.9 billion hostile takeover offer of Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), an American media conglomerate that owns an iconic movie studio, HBO, and other news and entertainment properties. The offer is meant to upend Netflix s deal to purchase WBD for $72 billion , which WBD accepted last Friday. Paramount s press release announcing the offer says that the $40 billion in equity financing will be backstopped by Ellison Family and RedBird Capital . The CEO of Paramount is David Ellison, the son of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, the second-wealthiest person in the world . RedBird Capital is an investment fund based in New York. (The rest of the cash for the purchase will be raised as debt from American banks.) What is not mentioned in the press release is that while the equity financing is backstopped by American individuals and entities, the majority of the equity financing $24 billion comes from the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, and Qatar. That fact is buried on page 42 of a separate SEC filing. $24 billion is a massive investment by foreign governments on Paramount s behalf. To put it in perspective, the current value of Paramount is just $15 billion . Also participating in the deal is Affinity Partners , the private equity firm run by President Trump s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Nearly all of Affinity Partners assets come from the same sovereign wealth funds bankrolling the proposed Paramount takeover of WBD. Kushner collects tens of millions in fees from Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries annually. Kushner s involvement in the deal highlights the ongoing legal and ethical problems with his dual role.

Two major news networks, CNN and CNBC, recently announced partnerships with Kalshi , an online predictions market. Kalshi allows the public to place bets on a dizzying variety of news events. There are currently Kalshi markets for the winner of the 2028 presidential election, next month s unemployment rate, next week s top TV show on Netflix, whether the announcers will say Cheesehead during Sunday s Green Bay Packers football game, and thousands of other future events. The CNN deal, which starts immediately, involves the integration of Kalshi data across CNN programming and a new Kalshi-powered real-time news ticker that will run during segments that feature Kalshi data. The CNBC deal, which begins in 2026 , will incorporate real-time prediction data into CNBC s editorial coverage across its TV, digital, and subscription channels. Kalshi will also create a CNBC page on its site, featuring CNBC-selected markets. The economic terms of the arrangement between Kalshi and the two networks were not disclosed. Unlike other prediction markets, Kalshi has sought regulatory approval from the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). After winning a lawsuit against the CFTC that allowed it to take bets on the 2024 presidential election, the platform has exploded in popularity. Trading volume is expected to exceed $50 billion in 2025, up from $300 million in 2024 . The new partnerships with CNN and CNBC will not only draw more users to Kalshi but fundamentally change the nature of news. It is no longer just a mechanism to learn about and understand world events. The news is now an opportunity to speculate on future events for financial gain.

The contract was for the manufacturing of 3,500 drone motors, and the Army also indicated it planned to order an additional 20,000 components from Unusual Machines next year. Trump Jr. was given 200,000 shares of the company s stock in 2024, which are now worth millions. Now, another small startup funded by 1789 Capital, a venture capital firm where Trump Jr. is a partner, will receive a $620 million loan from the Defense Department, the Financial Times reported . Vulcan Elements, which currently has around 30 employees, produces rare-earth magnets, which can be used in drones, radar systems and other military applications . The contract was awarded just three months after 1789 invested in Vulcan. The loan is part of a larger $1.4 billion deal announced last month that also involves another company, ReElement Technologies. It also includes $50 million from the Commerce Department and $550 million from private investors. In exchange, the Department of Commerce will receive $50 million of equity in Vulcan Elements. The Department of Defense will receive warrants for Vulcan Elements an option to buy a stake in the future according to a press release . Both Vulcan CEO John Maslin and Unusual Machines CEO Allan Evans said that Trump Jr. played no role in securing the government contracts.

Jared Kushner, President Trump s son-in-law, has been traveling the world to participate in high-stakes foreign policy negotiations on behalf of the president. On Tuesday, Kushner traveled to Moscow and sat across the table from Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine. The entire United States delegation consisted only of Kushner and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff. Kushner and Witkoff were joined at the table by an interpreter. Russian President Vladimir Putin begins a meeting with special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner in Moscow on December 2, 2025. (Kremlin Press Office/Anadolu via Getty Images) Kushner s participation in the Moscow meeting and the similar role he played in the Gaza negotiations likely violates the law. Representing the Trump administration in high-level foreign policy negotiations makes Kushner, at a minimum, a Special Government Employee (SGE). Under the law , an SGE is someone who is retained, designated, appointed, or employed to perform, with or without compensation, for not to exceed one hundred and thirty days during any period of three hundred and sixty-five consecutive days, temporary duties either on a full-time or intermittent basis. Trump has not named Kushner an SGE. But a seminal 1977 opinion by the Department of Justice s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) found an identifiable act of appointment may not be absolutely essential for an individual to be regarded as an officer or employee in a particular case where the parties omitted it for the purpose of avoiding the application of the conflict-of-interest laws. In that opinion, the OLC considered the status of an individual who had not been named to any role by the president but assumed considerable responsibility for coordinating the Administration s activities in [a] particular area. The OLC concluded that since the individual was quite clearly engaging in a governmental function and is working under the direction or supervision of the Pre",

U.S. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth stands before the game between the Detroit Lions and the Washington Commanders on November 9, 2025, in Landover, Maryland. (Photo by Lauren Leigh Bacho/Getty Images) Since September 2, the Department of Defense (DOD) has used drones to kill more than 80 people traveling by boat in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific. The government claims strikes targeted terrorists trafficking drugs into the United States. According to a New York Times report , the military does not know the names of all the people it has killed. Instead, the military carries out a strike on a boat if it knows that someone on the boats has a connection to a drug cartel, and it has some level of confidence that drugs are on the vessels. No evidence has been presented to the public and Colombia s government says that at least one of the strikes killed an innocent fisherman . Even if every person killed by the drone strikes was in fact a drug trafficker, it is unclear what authority the DOD has to kill them. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has argued that cartels are trafficking drugs to finance a non-international armed conflict against the U.S., giving the executive branch the authority under Article II of the Constitution to kill the drug traffickers without Congress signing off on a declaration of war. Lawmakers and legal experts have raised doubts that smuggling drugs into the U.S. constitutes initiating an armed conflict. Recently, new information has surfaced with the strongest evidence yet that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth committed a war crime in ordering at least one of the strikes. Last week, the Washington Post reported that Hegseth gave a verbal order to leave no survivors in the first strike of the DOD s campaign against drug smuggling boats, which took place in the Caribbean on September 2. Several minutes after striking the boat for the first time, the Special Operations commander overseeing the attack ordered a second strike to kill two men hanging o",

Lewis I have always been apprehensive about stating one truth about myself. This apprehension arises every time someone asks me, especially in the situation of a job interview, what are my strengths and weaknesses. While I have been able to give the answers quite convincingly, I usually never tell people that my greatest strength is that I am selfish with my time. Writing this piece has helped me ponder on the reasons that I hold back from this confession. I use the word confession intentionally because accepting this notion that I am selfish, at some level feels like a minor crime. So after some introspection, I was able to get down to the root cause of this feeling of apprehension. Growing up, I was always told and taught to be selfless, caring, and community bound. For a ton of reasons that teaching was right. From understanding what it means to have a collective thought process that is inclusive of everybody, to being there for one another in the good and bad times, this method did teach me a great deal. However, this teaching and lifestyle of being selfless also meant that I put others first. That means I put myself second or third, if not last. As I got older this teaching started conflicting with my beliefs and priorities. For once I was choosing to be selfish and think of myself first, and not second or third. When I started understanding the relevance of time, that is when I began to get more and more selfish about it. Most of us always chase financial freedom. I too was included in that list for the longest time. Instead what we should be chasing is freedom of time . The freedom to do whatever it is you want with your life, whenever you want.

They are both played on the field of incomplete information and you can never always win or lose. At no point in your life can you claim to know everything about the environment you are in and have the desired outcome. Poker is the same. It is the perfect blend of the known and the unknown. You know the cards that you draw and the ones on the table at every turn. What you don t know is what the other person has, and you have to act based on your judgment, skill, and luck.

For what it s worth, you cannot accomplish everything . I believe that you can accomplish things that fall within your strengths, level of perseverance, and unique skill set . As great as Newton and Einstein were in the field of Science, they would not have been as good or even close to being as good if they opted to be professional boxers. They just did not have the inclination, skills, or strength to excel in that field. The problem with believing that you can do everything is that quite often, you land up doing nothing. Everytime teenagers or young adults are told this lie, what happens is that at some level you are passively advocating that certainty is absolute if you put your mind to something. Most young people feel lost or uncertain because they do things that they think will lead to a certain and sure outcome, but those outcomes rarely come as desired. That s when they feel dejected because they were certain that they ticked all the boxes and that one can get whatever you want. The truth is, life always gets in the way. The reason I like Poker is that at the very basic level i",

    "text": "The Concept Of Thinking In First Principles The Theory Behind Non-Linear Thinking & Outcomes Photo by Joel Filipe on Unsplash The basis from which a thing is known - Aristotle (on First Principles) While researching this topic of First Principles, I was able to make an observation about myself which I would have otherwise not been able to make. That is, I was always conditioned on being taught why to think in a certain way, and very rarely taught how to think or what was the reason to do something. Life was just so instructional that the mind application was not needed in the formative years. This conditioning is a result of external and internal factors that have influenced my life in a small or large way but more importantly, I have allowed it to play a passive role in limiting my thought process over the years. As you read on, you will be able to relate to my concluding introduction to this piece. What are First Principles? First Principles is a basic proposition or assumption that cannot be deduced from any other proposition or assumption. In layman terms, it is the method of thinking which requires you to break down the problem or issue to its basic foundation. To the point where the thought or idea is completely pure, i.e. a place where assumptions are not required or do not work. A very popular story that encompasses this concept is of Elon Musk and SpaceX. Elon has been a great ambassador of First Principles Thinking. In 2002 when Musk wanted to begin working on sending a rocket to Mars, he was faced with a challenge big enough to shatter that thought process almost immediately. To send a rocket to Mars, you first need a rocket. So Musk decided to go shopping for one of the most expensive machines money can buy and soon discovered that the cost for one of those machines can go up to 65 million dollars. Around this point, this is what he said on what his next move was and how he came to think of it. I tend to approach things from a physics framework, Musk said in an interview. Physics teaches you to reason from first principles rather than by analogy",

When I see failure, I remind myself, that this too shall pass. - Dan Go The art of Detachment is probably one of the most misinterpreted concepts out there. A few common threads associated with this misinterpreted idea is that it is considered to be the trait of a complacent person or of one who withdraws from situations that fall outside of their comfort zone. These notions amongst others, could not be further from the reality of it. Detachment is a way of life that helps you get involved in situations without having to marry the outcome. Let s face it, when most of us get involved in a task or situation in our everyday lives, we tend to jump to conclusions about the outcome before having reached halfway through the process. One of the reasons for this behavior is that we tend to fall in love with the idea of doing something and the expected outcome we have created in our heads. It's sort of like teenage infatuation. Getting attached to something also means allowing yourself to be put in a vulnerable position as it takes up emotional headspace. The attachment issue is that it is usually unregulated and unchecked as it is built on a mountain of expectations that have a personal bias. While being attached to your loved ones and close friends do add depth and value in your relationships, being detached means to not get married to the image of those people you have created in your mind. Being detached teaches you one of the most basic and yet profound lessons. The only thing permanent in life is change. Once you understand that, half of your problems disappear. Why? Because most of them were anyways self-inflicted by your idea of how things should be rather than accepting how they are. Relationships When it comes to our relationships, issues usually start to arise around the time your illusion of the person and the person itself do not match. This could apply to any kind of",

If there s such a thing as a storytelling gene, Gladwell has some super-evolved DNA mutation.He might be the best storyteller on the planet. Malcolm Gladwell is the author of five nonfiction books and was recognised by Time Magazine in 2005 as one of the hundred most influential people in the world. All his books have been New York Times bestsellers, and he continues to be a writer for the New York Times, where he has worked since 1996. In his Masterclass, Gladwell covers almost everything there is for writers to know and learn. From the importance of having a catchy title for your story to how he identifies a story and develops it. The beauty of his class is that he gives details behind his thought process on every point that he talks about and illustrates them with perfect examples which adds the same value to you if you are beginning to write or you are someone who has been writing for a quite some time or simply an avid reader of his work. There is something in it for everybody. Lessons from his Masterclass that can have immense in understanding the craft of writing from a reader and writer s point of view. A Title is the ultimate attention grabber You have to spend as much time thinking about titles as you do about content. Malcolm talks about why he spends a great deal of time thinking about the title of his work. He says that the titles are the ads for your work. It is a split second that you have at your disposal to catch the reader s attention, so make it count. Let s take the example of Ralph Nader s Unsafe at Any Speed.

Along with their population, when you consider their geographic size and placement, you realise that outside help in the form of aid is crucial to their growth as nations. According to the World Risk Index of 2019, the Pacific Island countries are the most vulnerable to natural disasters and the effects of climate change. Five of these countries are ranked as in the list of 20 most at-risk countries in the world. Hence, no matter how small a country, but if the island nation of Tuvalu were hit with a natural disaster, the eleven thousand citizens of that country would take years to get the country back to normal without aid, because for such a small population this country is not quite that small. Some of the other major issues that these nations face that makes it crucial for them to depend on foreign aid are: Limited natural resources Narrow based economies Large distance from and major markets Vulnerable to external shocks such as wars and epidemics While the largest donor over the years has been Australia as these countries directly and indirectly (through the trade routes that go through their waters) contribute to Australia s GDP, China has been playing catch up and is currently ranked third just behind the United States with Taiwan also making regular contributions. So what has got China and Taiwan interested in providing aid to the Pacific Islands countries A small detour to the China Civil War To understand China s interest, a country with over 1.4 billion people and robust economic growth, in the Pacific Island Countries we need to go back in time to the Chinese Civil War and the events that took place subsequently.

The sooner we face that self, the better Ella Maillart We spend all the time and effort in the world trying to figure out everything around us but seldom put in half of that effort and time in figuring ourselves out. The lesser time we invest in knowing ourselves, the harder it gets to cope with the changing times and its relevance in our lives. Millennials like me fit into this description perfectly. We compete with everything and everyone around us and make the external environment and its stakeholders our holy grail. In a way, our fire is fueled not by our own innate abilities and desires to grow and get better, but by the accomplishments of those we know and hear of. We get inspired and motivated to then be like them or better. Whether it's a better-paying job, a new car, making a difference in the world (whatever that means) or having the money to spend on your vanity. The point is, you rarely or sometimes, never self-reflect. The lack of self-reflection and constant desire to build your world of expectations around somebody else's lives is probably the first step towards a mid-life crisis. While this feeling is quite common in people in the age band of 40 55, there is a sudden shift in the crisis's trend, hitting a much younger demographic. A survey conducted by Censuswide among 6,000 participants aged 25 33 concluded the following: 80% of the participants feel pressurised to succeed in either their careers, personal finance and relationships before touching the age of 30. 61% of people feel anxious about finding the right job or doing something they are passionate about. Nearly 48% of them said they feel pressured to match their peers in different aspects of life when they compare the growth or success they see.

Lying as a characteristic is not just limited to humans. In fact, Koko a gorilla, who reached new heights of fame in the 80s for mastering sign language, once blamed her pet kitten All Ball for ripping a sink out of the wall. Poor little All Ball had no idea that the animal that would cuddle her every day was blaming her for breaking a sink because she had been bad that particular day. Lying is one of the most primary traits we learn soon after we are born. Babies learn to fake a cry to get your attention, giving you the feeling that maybe they are not feeling alright. It is only when you fall for it you realize that even a six-month-old can outsmart you on its day with a cute lie. Pamela Meyer, author of the book Lie Spotting aptly points out that lying is a cooperative act . The harsh truth is that if you were lied to and felt betrayed or hurt it is because you allowed it to happen. An average person lies about 1.65 times a day . From little white lies, like that's a nice song or honey, that dress looks great on you to more serious lies that result in hurting people and making them feel betrayed, understanding when you are being lied to helps you be more reflective of yourself and the situation around you. Five of the easy and effective techniques you can use in everyday life to spot a lie are as follows: Convey vs Convince One of the most effective strategies you can use to gauge whether someone is lying to you or not is by interpreting their answers. Former CIA officer Susan Carnicero in her book Spy the Lie highlights that when people want to hide the truth from you, they unknowingly try to convince you with their answers rather than convey them to you. The easiest way to spot this trend is when you ask someone a question, and they talk for anywhere between seven to ten minutes, but not once do they ans",

The introduction of technology had initially made our lives not just easier but also highly efficient. A quote by Sophocles best describes the transition of technology in and around our lives today. Nothing vast enters the life of mortals without a curse The unregulated power and unlimited scope of technology have made us realise that while it does make our lives easier, it can and will also replace our utility in the not so distant future. Some of the changes we see today are already adding to the paranoia of tomorrow. For example, the biggest E-Commerce companies in the world are using robots in their warehouses for the work that was done by humans until five years ago. Postal and Courier's services are going to be on the brink of extinction once the drone delivery system is commercialised. There are multiple such examples which will eventually highlight the one common problem Humans can and will be replaced in their jobs by technology. Anticipating this problem and its consequences, various government officials, businessmen and scholars across the world suggested adopting the concept of Universal Basic Income to tackle the issue of future mass unemployment. What is Universal Basic Income (UBI)? UBI is a government-guaranteed payment system that provides the citizens of the country enough money to cover their basic cost of living, irrespective of whether they have a job or not. Simply put, UBI is the concept of giving free money to people so that they can continue to live their lives in the event of a situation where they lose their jobs. To some extent, a vague version of UBI is implemented in over a hundred countries today . Most countries have some cash transfer program for certain sections of society.

From having reinvented and redefined one of the most basic yet crucial aspects of women s clothing, to dealing with the highs and lows that come in business. She has persevered through it all and come out the other side victorious, successful and happy with her life. Her progress and ability to remain at the top of her game for over twenty years is what makes her stand out from the crowd. Yet, if you had to point at one particular aspect of what makes her different, that would be her formidable ability to drive change. Not only has she been a problem solver in her business, but also other areas of life. Sara is the first female billionaire to join the Giving Pledge , an organisation through which some of the wealthiest people in the world promise to donate at least their half their money to charity. The Sara Blakely Foundation today also invests millions of dollars in empowering and educating young women in the field of business and arts. Her masterclass symbolises everything she stands for and gives you a personalised and detailed lesson on entrepreneurship. Some of those learnings are: Understanding the market Before Sara began working on Spanx, she never wondered who was actually making and designing women s undergarments. As she got more involved in her business and began meeting people from manufacturing plants, she was surprised to know that men ran all manufacturing plants which made women s clothing. Around the time she had this revelation, Sara was able to narrow down her purpose for Spanx and understand the market she was going to be involved in. She realised you do not have to be the most experienced person in the field to redefine it. All you need to know is how to operate in a niche most effectively and uniquely, because quite often the people who are already making something similar may not have a unique knowledge required to disrupt that market time and again.

Gary Kovacs Source: letmeby.com Before the internet became a commercial necessity, the advertisement business was one of the most unique jobs in the corporate world. It is one of the few industries to have built its foundation on creativity, art, and business. In the past, content creators had to earn your time and level of engagement with ads. Sadly, today the internet allows them to track your movements and preempt your next move almost without your consent. From the point of privacy and independence to make decisions, customers were truly kings before the internet. The growing demand for the internet eventually pushed companies and creators into advertising their content online. Online advertising came at a cost that had to be paid by the customers with their time and privacy. For the longest time, internet users were not aware of how their data was being used to try and redirect their own decisions on the web. Clickbait ads became the norm and companies made hefty profits while customers were losing control. The goal of advertising today is not to be creative or engaging, but rather to entice you into buying a product or a service by following your footprints on the web. This may not be illegal, unethical, or immoral, but it indeed falls in that grey area. To tackle the issue of users losing their data on the web for advertisers without their knowledge, Brendan Eich and Brian Bondy created the Brave browser which incentivizes its users in cryptocurrency to view ads at their discretion without compromising on data privacy , giving the users 100% control of their decisions. Sound too good to be true? Before we dive in, let s consider our current online advertisements and the areas where it falls short.

Alan Lakein Photo by Tierra Mallorca on Unsplash Asa kid, I d remember my mother always telling me to save my money and put it in the piggy bank as I would be able to use that money for something bigger and better at a later date. I remember getting one of those piggy banks as a present around the age of ten and thought it was probably the dullest thing I had received all year. However, when I look back on that event, it s the first time the habit of saving money was inculcated in me, making it one of the most important lessons I have learnt. In a minimalistic way of sorts, that s the first step I had taken towards Financial Planning . The notion of saving your money to use it at a later date for a more significant purchase almost always sounds as good advice, even to a ten-year-old. (I think I was saving up for more Pokemon Cards at the time) Financial Planning today isn t as basic as saving money in your Piggy Bank (Bank Account), even though we wish it were. The process has quite a few variables that depict a roadmap towards a sound financial future for your Needs, Wants and Aspirations . Thus, also giving you a big reality check on whether or not you are on track to meet those goals. We usually focus on planning for something on primarily two significant occasions: Just before we make a major purchase like buying a house, or purchasing a new car. During the times of Uncertainty. The most relatable example to give here is the Pandemic, which results in loss of jobs, lower pay, decreasing standard of living, anxiety, etc. The problem with the above approach is that we are always caught off guard with the decision making process as it involves a degree of risk which we haven t been able to ascertain. This results in forcing us to make a choice of letting go of one need to have the other (technically known as the Opportunity Cost) . For example: If you have recently lost your",

    "text": "Why Is Emotional Intelligence Crucial In The Development Of An Individual How is it More Relevant Than the IQ of a Person One thing you can t hide, is when you re crippled inside John Lennon Photo by Tom Pumford on Unsplash Most of us are conditioned to believe that our ability to process and grasp information is the single most crucial factor to determine our success rate in life. Many of us define this ability of ours as the sole factor of intelligence. This interpretation of intelligence begins for us from a young age. Since the time I was in school, I always thought that the outcome of intelligence is to rank as the best in every field. Technically that is enough, I mean, ranking first is a clear indicator of you being at the top of the game, and the assumption is that you will succeed, as long as you continue to do what you are doing. The assumption that one will succeed in life by memorising the content of a book or winning in the numbers race in life to come first or second couldn t be further from the reality of the situation. Think about this, Christopher Langan , who is considered to be the smartest person in the world with an IQ of over 190, worked as a labourer and bouncer for most of his life. To put things in perspective, Albert Einstein had an IQ of 160, and he went on to develop the theory of relativity, which is one of the pillars of modern physics. There is absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to be a bouncer or a labourer. However, this begs the question of why wouldn t the smartest person in the world spend his time working on something significant to all of humankind? This is where the concept of Emotional Intelligence comes in. Emotional Intelligence is the ability to identify and understand your own emotions and the emotions of others. A lack of EQ in a person is mostly the reason that she/he is unable to progress in life or make peace with their choices or who they are at a deeper level. Simply put, the lack of EQ is the point of mental stagnation from which we can never return. This is because our ability to process and progress mentally is not being challenge",

Brian Chesky. Photo by Sean Pollock on Unsplash 14 Years. That is the amount of time it took Amazon to be called a Profit Making business. The year was 1997, and Jeff Bezos openly writes to his new investors a letter stating the importance of Market Share. It s All About the Long Term We believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term. This value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position. The stronger our market leadership, the more powerful our economic model. Market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue, higher profitability, greater capital velocity, and correspondingly stronger returns on invested capital. That year Amazon s sales increased by 838%, and their new customer accounts grew by 738% . Despite this insane level of growth, they were still a loss-making entity for another six years after 1997. From 2003 onwards the company has been showing an increase in its profits at a rate of 15% or more. In 2019 they reported a net profit of over USD 11 Billion. This business model of focusing on Market Share rather than Profit Share seemed to have paid off so well in the Long Term for Bezos and his company that almost every Startup in the world began following the same approach. What made this strategy come to life apart from the thriving example of Amazon was the belief that financiers and investors had in it. They believed that if a business has a unique business proposition and founders who understand the market and niche they want to operate in, then the only help it needs is financing it with a little bit of touch up in execution and publicity. Before we get into discussing the pros and cons of whether the Market Share Approach will work for businesses today, let s take a look at a company which focuses solely on the Profit Share model.

Photo by JESHOOTS.COM on Unsplash No other year has been as influential as 2020 in forcing our hand into using consumer tech products. One of the industries that have seen a monumental change because of technology is the Education Industry. Almost every school and university today has adopted the Online Learning Platform as the natural alternative to the traditional classroom approach. While this has made learning accessible to students and helped in the continuity of their education, there is a trade-off which may have a detrimental impact on the students in the long run. Since most of us are still getting accustomed to this new reality and trying to accept it, we haven t had the time to really analyse the downside of Online Learning for students. Over more extended periods, Online Learning can be counter-productive to a student s overall development for the following reasons: Fractures the Growth of Soft Skills We are so focused on ensuring the academic development of students is not restricted or hindered, that we quite often forget about the development of their personalities. One of the lesser discussed but crucial aspects of the traditional learning approach are the development of a student s soft skills. Whether it s the ability to communicate, developing your social intelligence or emotional intelligence, all these attributes are harnessed in an engaging and real learning environment.

We cannot limit ourselves to continuing on the path we have already opened Amancio Ortega. Source: cnbc.com November 2, 2016, Slack put out an audacious message to Microsoft just before the latter launched Teams, a competitive application that directly competed with Slack. The message was a full-page letter in the New York Times stating how Slack was genuinely happy to have the competition. The letter went on to offer a lesson to Microsoft on how to get the job done and why it would be difficult to replicate the success Slack has had. From Slack CEO, Stewart Butterfield s Twitter Handle At the time, most people were optimistic about Slack s prospects and what they stood to accomplish from the single product they provided to people and organizations across the world. In hindsight, I think we can all agree that everybody overestimated the growth of Slack and underestimated the influence of Microsoft. In July of 2020, Slack filed an EU competition complaint against Microsoft for bundling their Teams application with the Office Suite. Here is a small excerpt of the complaint : Microsoft has illegally tied its Teams product into its market-dominant Office productivity suite, force installing it for millions, blocking its removal, and hiding the true cost to enterprise customers. Slack s General Counsel reportedly said , They created a weak, copycat product and tied it to their dominant Office product, force installing it and blocking its removal, a carbon copy of their illegal behaviour during the browser wars. A couple of things are evident from the complaint filed by Slack. Contrary to what they once said in the New York Times letter, they are not genuinely excited to have Microsoft as a competitor. And, more importantly, a single product company will need to reinvent itself more often than expected to stay ahead of the competition.

Facebook decided to invest USD 5.7 Billion for 9.99% in Reliance Jio, thus becoming the largest minority shareholder in the company and get access to a country of 1.3 Billion people. What is Reliance Jio? Reliance Industries is owned and operated by India s Richest Man, Mukesh Ambani who in 2016 introduced his telecom network called Jio. His goal was simple and decisive. Penetrate the Indian telecom market by providing free internet service and voice calls to its users . Until this point, data services offered by existing telecom operators in India were similar to the standard global rates. Here is what Mukesh Ambani s Jio accomplished with providing free data and voice calls to its customers for almost one year: Jio was able to go on to add 300 million new users to their network, and most of whom were new users. Apart from it being a great value add for their business, having a large number of first-time users on the internet in the country also pushed the digital transformation initiative of the country as a whole. Jio is part of Reliance Industries which owns the largest oil refinery in the world. Thus, the parent company s financial position allowed them to raise a great deal of debt to cover for these services that were provided free of cost to its customers in their new telecom venture. The most significant advantage here was that an Oil Conglomerate was able to use its financial position to access debt to diversify the business towards the future of the 21st Century, i.e. Telecom and Data. Finally, obliteration of the competition. While competitors in the country were charging almost USD 5 for 1 GB of Data, the new guy comes in and gives you the same quality of 4G data for free.

In school, you re taught a lesson and then given a test. In life, you re given a test that teaches you a lesson. Tom Boded The MBA Program has been gaining prominence since it was first introduced as a management course by the Harvard Business School in the year 1908 and today is offered as a program by universities globally. The reason for this program was and still is to prepare students for the ever-changing business environment and provide a scientific approach to understanding the management aspects of the business. With time the degree has not only gained significant goodwill and popularity amongst parents and children, but it has also evolved to be the Gold Standard of Education globally. That is probably one of the reasons even I chose to pursue an MBA. It s been over three years that I have completed my degree, and in hindsight, my education still feels incomplete to a great extent . I don t blame the institute I studied as that was my choice as the overall experience was one to cherish, but I wish my education were more related to the career I am pursuing. This thought made me realise that maybe an MBA is not always the answer, and it certainly isn t enough to rely on. Some of the reasons that an MBA is simply not enough are: Education Relevance vs Career Opportunities While MBA programs have evolved with time to include specialisations such as Entrepreneurship, Marketing, Finance, etc., the programs are still not well equipped to prepare students for a wide range of profiles that each industry offers. Simply put, you have one or two years to learn as much as you can about one field of study. The fact that the process of learning is time-bound shows you the limitations of the scope of the study.

You know what Americans aren t talking about very much today after Trump s threat to detonate the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) this week and his threat this morning to invoke the Insurrection Act in Minnesota? They aren t talking a lot about the fact that the Department of Justice has released less than 1% of the Epstein files despite the law, the Epstein Files Transparency Act, Congress passed requiring the release of those files in full no later than December 19. Trump loyalists are trying to shift public anger at Trump over the files back to former president Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, whom QAnon conspiracy theorists believed were at the heart of a child sex trafficking scheme. Representative James Comer (R-KY) has threatened to hold former president Clinton in contempt of Congress for refusing to appear for a closed-door deposition about Epstein. But in a scathing four-page public letter to Comer, the Clintons called the subpoenas invalid and noted that Comer had subpoenaed eight people in addition to the Clintons and had then dismissed seven of them without testimony. They also noted that Comer had done nothing to force the Department of Justice to release all the Epstein files as required by law, including all the material relating to them, as Bill Clinton has publicly called for. They said, There is no plausible explanation for what you are doing other than partisan politics. The Epstein files are the backdrop for everything else, but also getting less attention than they would in any normal era are the fact that an agent for Immigration and Customs Enforcement shot and killed a 37-year-old white mother a little more than a week ago and that President Donald J. Trump, Vice President J.D. Vance, and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem all defended her killing by calling Renee Good and her wife domestic terrorists. As G.

Today is officially Ratification Day, the anniversary of the day in 1784 when members of the Confederation Congress ratified the Treaty of Paris that ended the Revolutionary War and formally recognized the independence of the United States from Great Britain. It almost didn t happen. On September 3, 1783, negotiators John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and John Jay for the United States, and David Hartley for Great Britain, had signed the document establishing the United States as an independent and sovereign nation. British officer Lord Cornwallis s surrender of 8,000 men to General George Washington on October 19, 1781, following the Battle of Yorktown had made it clear that Britain would have to agree to the independence of its former colonies, but the representatives of those colonies didn t have a lot to bargain with to shape the peace in their favor. What they did have was the ability to play different European powers off against each other, for the American Revolution, after all, was only a piece of a global conflict that included Great Britain, France, Spain, the Dutch Republic, Jamaica, Gibraltar, and India. Peace negotiations began in Paris in April 1782 and stretched on through the summer and into the fall. The United States were allied with France, which in 1778, just two years after the Declaration of Independence, had come to the rescue of the fledgling nation in its struggle with Great Britain. Spain and the Dutch Republic sided with the Americans too, hoping they could carve their way out from under King George, thus weakening Great Britain and enabling the European nations to take more global territory. With all these parties involved, negotiations were slow and sticky, especially as Spain wanted to continue to fight until it could capture Gibraltar from the British. (The Great Siege of Gibraltar, which took more than three and a half years, was actually the largest battle of the war in terms of combatants.) At the same time, French foreign minister Char",

Officials in the Trump administration insist its surges of federal agents into Democratic-led cities are necessary to round up undocumented immigrants, but the agents mission increasingly looks as if it is to frighten opponents of the administration into submission. But instead of submission, they appear to be sparking deeper and deeper opposition. Since agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee Good in Minneapolis, protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have broken out across the nation. Federal agents in Minnesota have responded by increasing their violent attacks, many of which have involved U.S. citizens and have been captured on video: agents breaking into a home with weapons drawn, a teenager dragged away from his job, agents guarding a restroom at Target, engaging in door-to-door searches without warrants, using illegal chokeholds, dragging people out of their cars. Confronted with footage of officers using prohibited chokeholds, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told ProPublica reporters Nicole Foy and McKenzie Funk: Officers act heroically to enforce the law and protect American communities. On Air Force One Sunday evening, Trump cut to the heart of MAGA s attacks on those resisting ICE when, speaking about Renee Good, he told reporters: At a very minimum, that woman was very, very disrespectful to law enforcement. Luke Broadwater and Katie Rogers of the New York Times noted the response of Representative Jamie Raskin (D-MD) to Trump s comment. Raskin recalled that the insurrectionists who attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, violently attacked police officers and called them everything from traitors to pigs to racial epithets, and ruthlessly taunted them and maligned them for hours, and yet Trump pardoned them. Raskin concluded that Donald Trump s very dubious characterization of Renee Good as having been disrespectful is not only factually suspect, but it s legally irrelevant.

While this sounds complicated, at its heart it s about the attempt of the Donald J. Trump administration to trample Congress and create a military loyal to Trump alone. Defense Secretary Hegseth came to his position from his job as a weekend host on the Fox News Channel. Before that, he served in the Army Reserve and the National Guard but, as Kelly and Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) noted in a Military Times op-ed questioning Hegseth s fitness for the position, he never rose to a command position and his track record falls short of military standards. He is the least-experienced defense secretary in U.S. history. His attack on Kelly, who is a retired Navy officer and astronaut, began after Kelly and five other Democrats in Congress Senator Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), and Representatives Chris Deluzio (D-PA), Maggie Goodlander (D-NH), Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA), and Jason Crow (D-CO) all of whom are veterans, released a video on November 18, 2025, in which they warned members of the military and the intelligence community that the administration was pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens.

A poster displaying an image of Renee Nicole Good is seen on January 12, 2026 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. (Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images) WHY THE HELL are federal forces brutalizing Minneapolis? Are the Twin Cities a bastion of undocumented immigrants? The Migration Policy Institute estimates around 100,000 people in all of Minnesota are in the country illegally. Sound like a lot? The organization s estimates for Florida , Texas , and California are 1.2 million, almost 2 million, and just under 3 million, respectively. Clearly, any immigration-enforcement pretext for a massive ICE surge is bullshit. The state s childcare fraud scandal a real problem first investigated years ago, which has been raised to public attention again thanks to the work of right-wing social media influencers has allowed for a convenient White House narrative to differentiate the Minneapolis operation from other recent ICE actions: Minnesota must be saved from itself. Possibly through the invocation of the Insurrection Act . It all amounts to one more scene in an ongoing production of political theater, as the federal agents themselves demonstrate by having their cameras constantly in hand, filming clips for DHS s aggressive social media campaign supporting their actions. The problem is that they are real masked agents in tactical gear nonetheless, and they re carrying real guns. Unchecked violence, including against U.S. citizens, was a likely possibility built into the foundation of this scenario. But why did Renee Nicole Good have to die? And why did the Trump administration move so swiftly after her murder to disparage her, label her a domestic terrorist, and investigate her? They even targeted her widow who, it should be remembered, was a witness to her wife s killing and likely heard her being called a fucking bitch by the ICE agent who pulled the trigger. Unfortunately, deaths at the hands of ICE are not a new phenomenon: In all my years covering immigration, I ve learned that o",

Agatha Christie (1890 1976) at her home, Greenway House, Devon, in January 1946. (Via Bettmann / Getty Images) FIFTY YEARS AGO THIS WEEK, the world lost a writer who remains the top-selling novelist of all time, having sold, to date, more than two billion copies in forty-four languages : Dame Agatha Christie, the Queen of Crime who died at the age of 85 at her home in a small town in Oxfordshire. Christie s career spanned most of the twentieth century. Her first mystery novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles , which introduced her famous Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, was written in 1916 and published in 1920. Her last novel, Sleeping Murder featuring Christie s other recurring sleuth, Miss Marple was written in the 1940s and published in 1976 after her death. She redefined the detective genre and became its icon (and sometimes affectionately mocked its clich s). While she was certainly not the first successful female author in that genre, she established with her contemporaries Dorothy Sayers and Ngaio Marsh that the genre was one in which women were not only equal but dominant. And, a half-century after her death, she has lost none of her ability to rivet the reader. BORN IN 1890 AS THE THIRD and last child of a well-to-do upper-middle-class British couple, young Agatha (n e Agatha Mary Clarissa Miller) was schooled at home until the age of 12; a voracious reader, she wrote her first poem at 10 and aspired to be a singer or pianist before she began to write at the age of 18. Her first short stories, mostly dealing with spiritualism and paranormal or quasi-supernatural themes, were all rejected; so was her first novel, Snow Upon the Desert (set in Egypt where Agatha and her mother had lived in 1907 08). Then, in 1920, The Mysterious Affair at Styles was published. By then, the former Agatha was married to military officer Archibald Archie Christie and had four years of service as a volunteer nurse in World War I behind her.

I m the former elected recorder for Maricopa County, Arizona and had a front-row seat to elections over the past six years. I m intimately familiar with the efforts to sow doubt in our elections and how delicate faith in our democracy has become. I urge you to let the normal process run its course.

It would strike a devastating blow to the confidence in our election laws. For years, Donald Trump and his allies have warned us election administrators that our time is coming, that we will be prosecuted, convicted, and imprisoned for our supposed crimes in 2020. The reality, as you know, is that we didn t steal the election. In fact, despite all the court cases , post-election audits , independent fraud sleuthing , Trump-initiated investigations , DOJ investigations , and state investigations , only one single, solitary election administrator out of tens of thousands of us throughout the United States has been criminally convicted in connection with the 2020 presidential election. That one, of course, is Tina Peters. If you believe in democracy, if you believe in our elections, if you believe in impact journalism become a subscriber. She was convicted because she betrayed the responsibilities of an election administrator.

President Donald Trump takes questions during a news conference following the 2025 NATO Summit on June 25, 2025 in The Hague, Netherlands. (Photo by Omar Havana/Getty Images) AMERICAN SABER-RATTLING over Greenland is pushing Europeans toward an unenviable choice: either to stand up to the bully and risk both the end of NATO and the end of U.S. support for Ukraine, or to accommodate Trump in the hope of keeping both going until Europe can secure its neighborhood itself. It is an unenviable dilemma, but there is one correct answer: to stand up to Trump. Alas, it is the answer that European leaders, in their defensive crouch, are less likely to pick. An ally that insists on the transfer of territory, by force or blackmail, is not a terribly reliable one, if it can be called an ally at all. Even before Greenland started dominating the headlines, the chances of the United States under Donald Trump s leadership coming to the defense of, for example, Estonia in the case of a Russian invasion looked unlikely. Accommodating Trump just to keep up the appearance of an alliance is a fool s errand. The summits, the common standards and interoperability, the military-to-military cooperation that characterize the transatlantic relationship are valuable only in the context of a shared willingness to fight together, as one team. But the Trump administration, as its National Security Strategy makes clear, sees the European theater as a vital U.S. interest only insofar as the United States can facilitate the dismantling of the EU and foster the emergence of ethnonationalist, Trump-aligned regimes. Recent reporting suggests that Trump is offering to buy Greenland to the tune of $700 billion, more than 2 percent of U.S. GDP . That is a staggering figure. There is no federal piggybank that can be smashed to come up with that much cash except a supplemental appropriation from Congress, which would face massive resistance so the administration is likely to reach that number with pledges of",

Good luck with that. (Composite by Hannah Yoest / Photos: GettyImages / Shutterstock) WHEN YOU RE WORKING WITH A MAD KING, as courtiers have done throughout history, one of the challenges is to steer him away from his worst ideas while pretending that the ideas aren t his. This is what Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) is now trying to do about Donald Trump s nutty obsession with seizing Greenland. Twice this week, Tillis has gone to the Senate floor to blame the Greenland fantasy on Trump s advisers. On Monday, Tillis pinned it on Stephen Miller, calling it a dumb idea that some deputy chief of staff thinks was cute to say on TV. On Wednesday, Tillis blamed it on whoever told the president that this was a viable path. The senator huffed that the amateurs who said it was a good idea should lose their jobs. A good adviser, said Tillis, would have informed Trump that NATO was the most important alliance in the history of the United States, that taking Greenland would destabilize the alliance, and that at one point we had seventeen military installations in Greenland, and they d be happy to have us back. Somebody, he demanded , needs to tell the president these things. All of this is ludicrous. People have been telling Trump these things for months. They ve said it to his face, on camera. And he has made it clear that he doesn t give a damn.

Federal agents deploy tear gas in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on January 14, 2026. (Photo by Madison Thorn/Anadolu via Getty Images) THE FOUNDERS EXPERIENCED INTIMIDATION and oppression by the British military, which is why, from the earliest days of our nation, they put restrictions on the ability of a president to use force against civilians. Fresh from a revolution, they designed a system that placed deliberation and civilian control between soldiers and citizens and gave Congress sole authority to declare war and appropriate money for the military. Later, when Congress passed the Insurrection Act in 1807, it did so not to create a convenient tool of governance, but to address rare breakdowns of order moments when citizens safety and constitutional authority itself are under threat, and no other option remains. That history explains why, for more than two centuries, presidents treated the Insurrection Act as a last resort. It is also why the military and scholars of civil-military relations were wary of the potential for any president to invoke it casually. But that reluctance has recently been eroded by rising executive impatience, the politicization and militarization of law enforcement, and an increasing tendency to view protest not as a constitutional right but as a provocation to be crushed. Within living memory, when presidents invoked the Insurrection Act, they did so in circumstances that were extraordinary and in line with how the drastic act was intended to be used. In 1957, President Dwight Eisenhower sent federal troops to Little Rock, Arkansas to enforce the law. State officials were actively defying a Supreme Court order to desegregate public schools, and the state s governor had used the National Guard to block black students from entering Central High School.

Given the chaos President Donald Trump has inflicted on the public since the start of the new year, it would be understandable if the Epstein files have slipped your mind. To get you back up to speed quickly: Lawmakers from both parties consider the Justice Department s piecemeal release of files so far to be wholly inadequate to what the law requires. They re not treating it as a small thing, either. In light of the DOJ s unexplained redactions and withheld documents, some members of Congress are pursuing legal action to force compliance, while others are gaming out potential legislative punishments for Attorney General Pam Bondi. Reps. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) and Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), who led the successful discharge petition for the bill Congress passed almost unanimously and Trump signed in November, have requested the courts act to stop the administration s flouting of the law. In a letter last week to Judge Paul Engelmayer of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Massie and Khanna wrote that the DOJ failed to meet the [Epstein Files Transparency] Act s requirements in multiple respects, including missing the statutory deadline, asserting common-law privileges that the Act does not permit, and applying extensive redactions that appear inconsistent with the Act s expressed prohibition on withholding or redacting records to protect politically exposed persons. . . .

(Photo by Madison Thorn/Anadolu via Getty Images) Lying Us Into a Crisis by Andrew Egger In the days immediately following the death of Renee Good, the protests that grew around the city remained strictly peaceful. But yesterday, in the wake of another ICE-involved shooting this time involving a Venezuelan man who was shot in the leg during an attempted traffic stop the situation started to boil over. Last night, protesters who gathered at the scene of the shooting scuffled with Border Patrol agents, ICE agents, and local and state police. They vandalized a car with police lights and at least one threw fireworks at ICE agents. The federal agents, meanwhile, deployed tear gas and pepper sprayed multiple protesters on the scene. Several protesters were detained and later released. The ongoing tensions between local cops and federal agents were on display as well: According to the New York Times , a Minneapolis police officer told several protesters on the scene that he wasn t sure what all had happened: It s not like they re talking to us, he said of the federal officers. City leaders, including Mayor Jacob Frey, have urged protesters to remain peaceful. Last night, Frey explicitly condemned any who failed to do so: This is not creating safety, he said. For those that have peacefully protested, I applaud you. For those that are taking the bait, you a",

An onlooker holds a sign that reads Shame at the site of the killing of Renee Good on January 7, 2026 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. (Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images) WE VE SEEN MASKED GOVERNMENT AGENTS roughing people up , shouting obscenities at them, trapping them on freezing cold roofs, smashing their car windows, shooting pastors with pepper balls, shoving women to the ground, separating mothers from their children, and killing an unarmed American citizen as she attempted to maneuver her car away, dog in the backseat and glove compartment overflowing with colorful stuffed animals. This is not just excessive anti-immigrant zeal. This is certainly not the normal push and pull between political philosophies or parties. This is the Republican party s attempt to tyrannize the American people and transform our carefully balanced, rights-honoring republic into a thugocracy. Why was Renee Good executed in cold blood? Because, our jefe explained , that woman was very, very disrespectful to law enforcement. That s a lie, as the 80 percent of Americans who watched the videos can attest. Her last words were I m not mad at you. But even if it were true, we live in a country that protects speech even disrespectful speech above nearly all other things. That means a person cannot be penalized say, pulled over or denied a government benefit for exercising their First Amendment rights. And, oh yes, it certainly means that they cannot be murdered by the state for being disrespectful. You know where that can happen? In places like Venezuela, Iran, Russia, and China countries ruled by thugs. Before Renee Good s body was cold, before a single question had been asked in any investigation, the secretary of homeland security declared her to be a domestic terrorist and asserted that she was attempting to run down the officer who killed her. Having blamed and defamed the victim, the administration next attempted to investigate and perhaps prosecute her widow while blocking inquiries in",

    "text": "Time to End the Last U.S.–Russia Nuclear Treaty The agreement is no longer in America s interests. (Shutterstock) THE LAST BILATERAL U.S. RUSSIAN nuclear arms control treaty, the New START treaty, is set to expire on February 6. President Trump, who recently indicated he is not troubled by the potential expiration of the treaty, must nevertheless make a decision before then either to allow the treaty s central limits to be extended, as advocated by Vladimir Putin and several of his factota, or to allow the treaty to fall into history s dustbin. As we have written on several occasions , a truly America First policy would end the treaty . Extending the treaty would put not only Russian but also Chinese desires above American interests. New START was defensible when it was concluded sixteen years ago, but times have changed, and now no treaty would be far preferable to an extension. First, the treaty condemns us to an inferior position against the two major nuclear threats facing us. Thanks to China s rapid nuclear buildup, for the first time in history, the United States faces the prospect of simultaneously deterring two peer or near-peer nuclear powers. New START, which dates from an era when China was a less significant nuclear power and Russia was less aggressive and bellicose, blocks the United States from modifying our current nuclear deterrent to address both Russia and China, two dictatorships whose leaders increasingly act in concert. The treaty, signed in 2010, allowed for a U.S. strategic force sized almost exclusively to deter Moscow from nuclear attacks against the United States and our allies. The world has changed, and the 2010 force size is too small for our current and future needs, but New START prevents us from increasing it. Get reliable reporting and savvy commentary on the stories that matter most. Become a Bulwark+ member: Second, the treaty is toothless. Russia has already violated it by ignoring its inspection and transparency requirements. Putin s proposal to extend only the warhead and launcher limits for both sides would leave unaddressed",

    "text": "The Anti-'Abolish ICE' Crowd is Living In the Past It's not 2018 anymore. Stephen Maturen/Getty Images In the aftermath of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent senselessly killing 37-year-old Renee Good , a coalition of think tank staffers, political journalists, and media-obsessed members of Congress has identified the most pressing problem: abolishing ICE. Or rather, the suggestion that we should abolish ICE. What was once a rallying cry during President Donald Trump s first term took a backseat when Joe Biden took over. Biden presided over a confused and erratic border policy that ultimately saw ICE deport more people in Biden s last year in office than any of Trump s first four. The call to eliminate ICE, however, is now resurfacing after a full year of unconstitutional raids, brutal roundups, and the killing of Good and 43-year-old Keith Porter by federal agents. This is a disturbing development for a particular crew of scolds who keep insisting they have the only answers for how the Democrats can win elections again. On Wednesday, multiple outlets reported on a new memo from the Searchlight Institute , a think tank run by Adam Jentleson, a former chief of staff to Sen. John Fetterman and aide to the late Sen. Harry Reid. The memo, written by a former Biden DHS official, claimed that advocating for abolishing ICE is tantamount to advocating for stopping enforcement of all of our immigration laws in the interior of the United States. (Third Way, the longstanding policy shop of Democratic centrism, put out a similar memo this week .) Instead, the report called for replacing the abolish ICE slogan with reform and retrain, and the policy of abolition with one that bans masks, prosecutes agents who break the law, and promotes community policing. In case this didn t remind you enough of the Democratic proposal to reform police after 2020, one part of the reform proposal reads: Identify and weed out the rotten apples.

Octavio Jones/AFP via Getty Images On January 7, 37-year old mother Ren e Nicole Good was shot three times in the face by an armed ICE officer later identified as Homeland Security agent Jonathan Ross as she attempted to pull her car away from an active immigration raid she d been monitoring in South Minneapolis. Although federal deportation troops had already been operating in and around the Twin Cities, where I live, for some time, Good s death, and the incandescent city-wide rage that followed, have inspired the Trump regime to double down on its reflexive need to terrorize and subjugate its enemies. As things currently stand, there are currently more than twice as many ICE agents roaming Minneapolis and St. Paul as there are local police. Share Practically speaking, this means that the place I call home is living under an occupying army one that has demonstrated not only a willingness for violence, but a compulsive hunger for the most ostentatious displays of force it thinks it can get away with. ICE and CBP officers are grabbing people from their cars at gas stations and busy intersections, leaving glass and blood on the concrete as their fleets of tinted SUVs speed from the inevitable cacophony of whistle blasts that follow them across the metro. Phalanxes of armed goons have splintered front doors while families huddle terrified in the back of their homes. Streets everywhere are deserted. Restaurants are closed. Everyone is terrified.

    "text": "Renee Nicole Good's Murder Is Not Up for Debate Fascist spin and an abdication of journalistic responsibility won't change what we can see with our own eyes. Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images Yesterday in Minneapolis, an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Nicole Good in her car. The 37-year-old was pulling away from officers when the agent fired three shots at close range. The murder is not shrouded in any mystery whatsoever. There s very clear and accessible videos of the incident. You would not know that though if you relied on CNN. Their initial coverage made it seem like the whole thing was a massive whodunit that needed solving: You wouldn t know it if you relied on The New York Times , either. Here s what they reported right after the shooting ( shout out to Jack for capturing ) Neither description of the encounter could be immediately verified independently is an interesting way to put it. What a super odd sentence to write and publish when it could indeed be verified. Quite easily, in fact. It was an easy job for the public, and what should have been an easy job for the Times team, for whom it is literally their job. That graf has since been edited , though the edit doesn t improve much on the original, and subsequent updates didn t either: This is outrageous. A woman was murdered by what is essentially a state-sanctioned terrorist organization and there are many clear videos depicting the incident in full. It could not be more cut and dry. But the Times coverage remained focused on the debate over why it happened and, it would seem, whether the government had any justification in slaughtering one of its citizens. (The paper took until Thursday morning to conclude that guess what? the videos of the shooting contradicted the official line.) Subscribe now The sinister passive voice in news coverage is not a new or rare phenomenon, but with events like this, the docile tone feels especially deranged.

    "text": "The Word For This Is 'Coup' The media must call what Donald Trump just did in Venezuela by its proper name. Via Donald Trump There is a readily available four-letter word that describes what Donald Trump did this past weekend namely, violently overthrowing the leader of a sovereign state and vowing to replace him with a leader who will do the bidding of Trump and his government. The word is coup. That is what has just happened: Donald Trump and the government of the United States carried out a coup in Venezuela. Trump sent the U.S. military into Venezuela, abducted President Nicol s Maduro on blatantly illegal grounds , flew him to a federal jail in Brooklyn, and then repeatedly declared on camera that the U.S. would now be running Venezuela and profiting from its oil wealth. That s called a coup. There is no ambiguity about any of this. Usually, American presidents at least the ones of the past 80 or so years, when the international rules-based order meant you had to pretend a little more like to hide behind a fig leaf of deniability when they engineer coups in other countries. Don t look at us! It was the people and the people alone who decided to overthrow Bolivia s Evo Morales in 2019 ; Honduran President Manuel Zelaya in 2009 ; Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 2004 ; Maduro s predecessor Hugo Ch vez in 2002 ; Argentina s Isabel Per n in 1976 ; Chile s Salvador Allende in 1973 ; Bolivia s Juan Jos Torres in 1971 ; Brazil s Jo o Goulart in 1964 ; the Congo s Patrice Lumumba in 1960 ; Guatemala s Jacobo Arbenz in 1954 ; Iran s Mohammad Mosaddegh in 1953 ; and many other people I ve surely forgotten.

He declared that a group of his favorite psychopaths, including Marco Rubio and Pete Hegseth, will be in charge for the foreseeable future. He threatened to oust Venezuela s acting leader, Delcy Rodriguez, if she doesn t get with the program. He even called his actions an attack on sovereignty.

NBC Much has been said about what late-night television has lost and risks losing more of with the looming cancellation of CBS Late Show with Stephen Colbert , the attempted muzzling of ABC s Jimmy Kimmel Live , and our general slide toward a popular culture defined by AI slop and IP necrophilia. If you re not up to speed and short on time, I ll spare you the details, but the broad takeaway here is that it s all pretty bad. Throughout the turbulence of this past year, however, there s been one late-night host who s successfully avoided any hint of controversy or, for that matter, critical thinking.

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images President Donald Trump, once convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records, announced on Wednesday that he planned to pardon Democratic Representative Henry Cuellar of Texas, who is awaiting trial for allegedly accepting over $600,000 worth of bribes while in office. Donald Trump pardoning white collar criminals is nothing new, but this is one of the first times that this practice has now been extended to a member of the opposing political party all because Cuellar spoke out against the former Biden administration s immigration policies. We all know the government is corrupt. There are several apps online that let you track and mirror the stock trading practices of members of Congress, like former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, who out-earned every private hedge fund in 2024 . Politicians receive huge campaign contributions through a shadowy network of dark money, slide into lucrative private sector jobs as soon as they leave office, and generally use their elected power to systematically enrich themselves in a myriad of other ways. Before Donald Trump, most of these ways were quiet, or complicated enough that they were difficult for ordinary people with jobs to fully grasp, or simply legal.

It makes you paranoid. I have spent the better part of an hour on two-sentence emails in order to phrase something in such a way that it does not expose me to legal action. I am terrified every day of letting something slip by me or messing up or getting caught cutting a little corner in all of the ways that every writer cuts corners sometimes. You never know when one of those things will blow up in your face, when the wrong word or promise will sink a story or sour it after publication. I live in fear of having to issue corrections and I replay the mistakes I have made in my mind over and over again in my head, wincing as if I am in physical pain, when I am lying in bed next to my wife, dead tired but unable to sleep in the wee hours of the morning. It is a fantastic job and I never want to have any other. If I ever fucked up so bad that I lost it, I m not sure what I would do. Fucking up that bad feels like a very real possibility. Different publications have varying sets of hyper-specific standards which are often set by lawyers and comically pedantic dorks, but the basic ethics that a journalist should have are pretty simple. Do not write lies. Do not take bribes. Do not plagiarize other work and definitely do not make stuff up that didn t happen. The last two are really the cardinal sins of journalism. If you re caught doing them it s basically a guarantee that you will lose your job, and very likely that you will never work in the field again. Those sins receive death sentences for good reason in committing them, you have indicated that you adhere to none of the very simple ethics of the profession.

This January, Governor Spencer Cox signed a law forcing anyone who visits a public school or a government building to use the restroom that matches the gender on their birth certificate, regardless of their current gender identity. To enforce this creepy law (seriously, why are Republicans thinking so much about other people s bathroom habits?), the state set up an online snitching form where transphobic Utahns can report any case of Toilet Crime they happen to encounter. It didn t go well for them. Utah s state auditor John Dougall, who s been tasked with checking on the online reports, is visibly frustrated with the absurd nature of the job, saying last week that No auditor goes into auditing so they can be the bathroom monitors. And as it turns out, virtually all of the 10,000 submissions the form received so far have been a troll. Some have named Dougall himself as the witness to the alleged incident, while others have included pictures of screaming cats, adult actor Barry Wood, anime memes, the script for The Bee Movie, and so on. This isn t the first time something like this has happened. Back in February, we told you about a similar case where a transphobic reporting site started by Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita got inundated with gibberish, including the memorable trans Godzilla meme. There was also a reporting form about trans healthcare in Missouri (where one user submitted a fake report in character as Breaking Bad s Walter White), and another in Virginia in 2022 , which seems to have been the first of its kind. It s always amusing when these efforts fall flat on their face, but it s serious too. Reporting people to the police (or the state auditor) simply for not conforming to gender n",

Click HERE to learn more. The news will never betray you STORIES THAT SHOULD BE BIGGER Romney and Blinken have admitted the real reason for TikTok ban legislation Last week, President Biden signed a bill banning the Chinese-owned social media platform TikTok unless it is sold to an American company. Much of the discourse in favor of the ban centered on scantily evidenced, often vague claims about the possibility of China using it to harvest Americans information. But some comments made this week at the John McCain Institute Forum by Senator Mitt Romney and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have made clear what many, including us , suspected: That this ban had little to do with Americans safety and privacy and was instead about keeping a lid on the information they are allowed to freely access, particularly that which might lead viewers to call America s foreign policy narratives and objectives into question. The subject of TikTok came up when Romney asked Blinken why he thought the PR has been so awful for Israel since they are typically good at PR. Blinken said that some of it was due to an intravenous feed of information with new impulses, inputs every millisecond, He continued: And of course the way this has played out on social media has dominated the narrative. You have a social media ecosystem, environment in which context, history, facts get lost and the emotion, the impact of images dominate. We can t discount that, but I think it also has a very, very challenging effect on the narrative. Romney added on in even more explicit terms: Some wonder why there was such overwhelming support for us to shut down TikTok or other entities of that nature. If you look at the postings on TikTok, the number of mentions of Palestinians relative to other social media sites, it s overwhelmingly so among TikTok broadcasts.

S. Chapin Domino, publisher of Current Affairs Magazine STORY THAT SHOULD BE BIGGER House bill attempts to punish Israel critics on campus As thousands of students around the U.S. have risen up to protest Israel s war in Gaza, a terrifying new bipartisan bill is making its way through Congress to punish anti-Zionist speech. H.R. 6090, the Antisemitism Awareness Act, which passed the House this week by an overwhelming 320-91 vote, adds a new and much more expansive definition of antisemitism to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that the Department of Education will be required to enforce. Alongside classic forms of Jew-hatred like Holocaust denial, blood libel, and calls for violence against Jewish people, the new definition adopted from the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance labels many criticisms of Israel as forms of discrimination. The new definition lists the following as forms of antisemitism: Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor. Applying double standards by requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation. Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis. In addition to being highly vague and subjective, this definition effectively renders it verboten to make claims about Israeli policy that are completely reasonable and widely acknowledged to be true. Image: C-SPAN Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International , the Israeli human rights group B Tselem, and the United Nations have classified Israel s policies toward Palestinians as a form of apartheid a racist system because they are deprived of self-determination, due process, voting rights, and freedom of movement on the basis of their ethnicity.

Slurp up some news! ICC reportedly preparing arrest warrants for Netanyahu & Co. The Israeli government is freaking out at the possibility that its leaders could be hit with arrest warrants by the International Criminal Court for war crimes in Gaza. On the 28th, the Times of Israel reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant (you know, the we are fighting human animals guy), and IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi could be facing charges, a prospect that Netanyahu called a scandal on a historic scale. The ICC an international body that can prosecute individuals for genocides and other crimes against humanity has not yet confirmed that it intends to prosecute members of the Israeli government, but suspicions abound. A source told The Times of Israel that the Israeli government is making a concerted effort to head off feared plans by the International Criminal Court to issue arrest warrants, which will most likely be on charges that Israeli leaders have deliberately starved Palestinians in Gaza. According to The New York Times , senior Hamas leaders may also be charged for war crimes committed during the October 7 invasion of Israel. Axios , meanwhile, reports that members of the US Congress are attempting to prevent the ICC s issuing of warrants as well. A courtroom at the ICC, on the institution s 10th anniversary. (Image: Wikimedia Commons ) For months now, it has been clear that Israel is using starvation as a weapon of war by blocking the entry of aid to the Gaza Strip, leaving it in a state of famine. Israel has blocked aid shipments, restricting them to far below the necessary amount to feed the population of Gaza and, on more than a dozen occasions, fired on unarmed Palestinians trying to reach food aid and bombed aid trucks.

Last week, the NYPD hauled off more than 100 Columbia students despite acknowledging that they were completely peaceful, a move cheered by politicians in both parties. But rather than strike fear, state repression has only strengthened the resolve of America s youth. They have only continued to turn out around the country in droves to oppose their schools investments in weapons contractors who have profited from a war that is killing innocent people at a historic rate . According to the Associated Press: Universities with large endowments spread their money across a vast array of investments, and it can be difficult or impossible to identify where it all lands. The U.S. Education Department requires colleges to report gifts and contracts from foreign sources, but there have been problems with underreporting , and colleges sometimes dodge reporting requirements by steering money through separate foundations that work on their behalf. According to an Education Department database, about 100 U.S. colleges have reported gifts or contracts from Israel totaling $375 million over the past two decades. The data tells little about where the money comes from, however, or how it was used.

Last week, more than 100 student demonstrators were arrested for trespassing after Columbia called the NYPD, though the police have since acknowledged that everyone taken into custody was peaceful. Since then, the Gaza Solidarity Encampment has persisted, even despite student activists being suspended and evicted from their homes , with protests continuing and growing larger over the weekend despite the threats. Despite the crackdown, students at more than a dozen other schools have begun similar protests. This weekend s coverage focused almost solely on the disruption caused by the student protesters at Columbia, who were often described with some of the most hyperbolic language in recent memory. Legislators urged the national guard to violently disperse them while one Columbia business professor described the students as terrorists. As always, the protesters were widely condemned as violent antisemites by politicians in both parties with little evidence. Senator John Fetterman (D-PA) compared Columbia students to the tiki torch-wielding Nazis in Charlottesville, Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) described their demonstrations as nascent pogroms , calling for President Biden to break up the encampment. President Biden himself described them as antisemitic protests. There was meanwhile nary a mention of the fact that hundreds of participants are in fact Jewish themselves. You don t have to look far to spot protests in the encampment wearing kippahs and holding signs with slogans like Jews for Palestine.

Every Which Way But News STORIES THAT SHOULD BE BIGGER NESTL GETS BABIES HOOKED ON SUGAR IN POORER COUNTRIES Thanks to the Swiss investigative journalism group Public Eye , we now know something alarming about one of the world s largest food and childcare companies. In an extensive series of product tests, researchers with Public Eye and the International Baby Food Action Network (IBFAN) compared baby products sold by Nestl in various countries, testing them for added sugars and other sweeteners. In particular, they looked at packages of Cerelac infant cereal and Nido powdered milk, two of Nestl s most popular brands. In both cases, the investigation found that Nestl was adding sugar to the mix when the products were sold in poorer countries : Almost all the Cerelac infant cereals examined contain added sugar nearly 4 grams per serving on average, equal to roughly a sugar cube although they are targeted at babies from six months of age. The highest amount 7.3 grams per serving was detected in a product sold in the Philippines. Most of the Nido powdered-milk products for young children from one to three years old examined also contain added sugar almost two grams per serving on average. The maximum value (5.3 grams) was detected in a product sold in Panama. In Switzerland and in Nestl s main European markets, such products are sold without added sugar. To state the obvious, there s a reason European countries don t want added sugar in their baby food. As Rodrigo Vianna, a Brazilian nutritionist who spoke to Public Eye, points out , it s unnecessary and highly addictive, and can cause infants to get used to the sweet taste and start looking for more sugary foods, starting a negative cycle that increases the risk of nutrition-based disorders in adult life, including obesity and diabetes. Obesity in particular is an ongoing global health crisis that affects roughly an eighth of the world s population, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where the World Hea",

STORIES THAT SHOULD BE BIGGER THE NEW YORK TIMES DON T SAY PALESTINE POLICY New reporting from Ryan Grim and Jeremy Scahill at The Intercept has revealed that The New York Times has systematically restricted writers from honestly covering basic facts about the war in Gaza and the broader Israel-Palestine conflict, and required them to use language that downplays attacks on Palestinians and defers to Israel s framing of the conflict. An internal memo on journalistic objectivity, written by standards editor Susan Wessling, international editor Philip Pan and their deputies, reportedly: Instructed journalists covering Israel s war on the Gaza Strip to restrict the use of the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing and to avoid using the phrase occupied territory when describing Palestinian land. The memo also instructs reporters not to use the word Palestine except in very rare cases and to steer clear of the term refugee camps to describe areas of Gaza historically settled by displaced Palestinians expelled from other parts of Palestine during previous Israeli Arab wars. The Times also told reporters to refrain from using the incendiary phrase genocide when describing Israel s killing of tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians, including 15,000 children , including in quotes unless the speaker provides a legal argument for it. But the paper has not employed a similar restraint for Hamas attacks against Israelis. Another memo encouraged reporters to refer to Hamas October 7 attacks against Israeli civilians as terrorism and to avoid using more neutral language like militant. It does not, however, use the phrase terrorism to describe Israel s attacks on hospitals, aid trucks, and civilian infrastructure. There s some seriously shady stuff going on in this building.

As human-generated climate change causes the polar ice caps to melt at an alarming clip, Miami, Tampa, and Jacksonville will be among dozens of US cities that may become submerged by rising sea levels within the next century. This is considered a longshot possibility. More likely, sea level rise will be limited to between 1.4 and 2.8 feet, which would still be catastrophic, leaving coastal cities partially flooded as soon as 2050. This is what Florida would look like if sea levels rise the predicted two feet. The IPCC has not ruled out that it could be three times this bad. The Current Affairs offices in nearby New Orleans would also probably have to relocate to higher grounds. (Screenshot from the NOAA s Sea Level Rise Tracker ) But Florida s Republican leaders don t seem terribly concerned about stopping this from happening. Rather, they seem more concerned about preventing anyone from acknowledging why the problem exists at all. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis will soon receive a bill that would strike the majority of the mentions of the phrase climate change from state laws. According to The Tampa Bay Times : The bill would repeal entire sections of law that mention climate change, such as a grant program that helps local governments and school districts reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The bill would also reduce certain regulations on natural gas pipelines, preempt local governments control over the location of natural gas storage facilities and make it so state agencies and local governments no longer have to consider fuel efficiency when buying vehicles, among other changes.

Bearing a large sign that reads ACTIVE DUTY AIRMAN REFUSES TO EAT WHILE GAZA STARVES, Hebert took up a position outside the White House on Easter Sunday and has stood there, every day from 10 AM to 3 PM, from April 1 through 6. The whole time, he s done exactly as the sign says, consuming only water and a little juice no more. On April 8 he moved to the House of Representatives to begin Week Two of his protest, and tells interviewers he ll carry on as long as he s physically able: \"I don't have a stop or an end for it right now,\" Hebert told Military.com in a phone interview. \"I'm going to go until my body cannot go any longer or we get the cease-fire and the end of unconditional aid to Israel.\" (Image: Palestine Online via Twitter ) As he tells it, Hebert s motivations are twofold. First, he s been working as a technician at a U.S. naval station in Rota, Spain, where he s seen firsthand the weaponry the Biden administration is currently sending to help the Israeli government massacre Palestinians: I m seeing all the cargo that comes through from the States and is coming overseas and going to Israel and they re just massive, massive missiles that are going to be used on mostly civilians. So there s a direct role there. We don t have to send these weapons. And secondly, Hebert says he was inspired by the example of Aaron Bushnell, his fellow Air Force member who self-immolated as an extreme act of protest for Gaza back in February: When Aaron Bushnell took his own life at the Israeli Embassy for the people of Gaza, that had a profound impact on me.

BIG STORY ISRAELI AIRSTRIKE KILLS SEVEN AID EMPLOYEES IN STARVING GAZA This week in the Gaza Strip, seven workers for the World Central Kitchen, a renowned humanitarian aid organization, were killed when the Israeli military launched at least three airstrikes upon a convoy of aid vehicles. The WCK has provided humanitarian aid to war and disaster zones around the world since 2010 and has delivered more than 32 million meals to the people of Gaza, who face starvation as the result of the Israeli military s blocking of humanitarian aid. According to a new Oxfam analysis, just 41 percent of the food necessary to feed the population has been allowed to enter the Strip since October, with people in the North of Gaza living on just 245 calories a day. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called the strike a tragedy, but insisted that it was unintentional. Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, blamed a misidentification even though the convoy was clearly marked with the emblem of the aid organization, which has long coordinated its routes and aid activities with the IDF. WCK founder Jose Andres was unconvinced by Israel s denials, noting in an interview with Reuters that, They were targeting us in a deconflicting zone, in an area controlled by IDF. He later added, The airstrikes on our convoy I don't think were an unfortunate mistake. It was really a direct attack on clearly marked vehicles whose movements were known by everybody at the IDF. Photo: Ismael Abu Dayyah, AP This certainly seems probable. More than 200 aid workers have been killed in Gaza since October 7, making it the deadliest conflict zone in the world for humanitarians. This is also far from the first time Israel s military has fired on humanitarian aid deliveries. In late February, Israeli troops fired upon Palestinians collecting flour from an aid truck, killing at least 112 and wounding more than 700, an atrocity dubbed the Flour Massacre.

STORIES THAT SHOULD BE BIGGER THE PAPERS MOHELA DOESN T WANT YOU TO READ If you have student debt in the United States, there s a decent chance it s handled through MOHELA the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority, one of the largest student-debt servicers in the country. According to its own investor presentations , the company now manages 8.4 Million Borrower Accounts, or $375.8 Billion of Student Loans as of January 2024. And as it turns out, executives at MOHELA really don t want you looking into how they manage, or mismanage, those loans. The scope of debt has increased dramatically. (Chart: The MOHELA Papers ) Late last month, MOHELA sent a cease-and-desist letter to the Student Borrower Protection Center , a nonprofit group that advocates for student debt relief and the rights of borrowers. It alleges that the Center made false and misleading claims about MOHELA s work, and that MOHELA suffered serious damage as a result. But when you dig a little deeper, it becomes clear that misleading claims really just means document analysis, and serious damage means the mildest degree of public accountability. At issue is a lengthy report called The MOHELA Papers, which the Center released in collaboration with the American Federation of Teachers on February 28. In its pages, researchers examine public records, borrower accounts, and thousands of pages of documents gathered under Missouri s open records laws. They conclude that MOHELA has systematically mismanaged the loans under its purview, having miscalculated borrowers payment amounts, lost borrowers payments, refunds, and records and misinformed borrowers about their options, among other improper practices. The biggest bombshell in the Papers is MOHELA s call deflection scheme, which has only recently come to light.

Currently, the U.S. list price for a month s supply of the popular drug is $935.77 but according to the new study, the cost to manufacture it is dramatically lower than that. In fact, the scientists found that a month s worth of Ozempic (scientifically known as semaglutide ) can be made for anything from 89 cents to $4.73 , including taxes and a profit margin. The profit Novo Nordisk currently makes from selling it, meanwhile, is exorbitant. Whether paid out-of-pocket or by insurance companies, the vast majority of that $935.77 asking price appears to be pure corporate greed. This is a bigger problem than it might seem. Although Ozempic has become famous as an appetite-suppressing weight loss drug, it s also a vital medicine for people with diabetes meaning that when it s overpriced, people who don t have a spare $935.77 a month may be forced to go without. And as Josh Nathan-Kazis reports for Barron s , the drug s exorbitant cost could break the healthcare system in the United States. In recent months, Novo Nordisk has spent millions of dollars lobbying the federal government to expand Medicare s coverage of weight loss drugs like Ozempic, and they ve had some success, convincing Representative Brad Wenstrup (R-OH) to introduce the Treat and Reduce Obesity Act of 2023. If Medicare has to cover Ozempic (and similar Novo Nordisk drugs like Wegovy ) for weight loss as well as diabetes, and the prices remain at their current high level, it could add billions of dollars in cost to an already-strained federal program, pushing it to the breaking point.

Take this news. BIG STORY U.N. ORDERS RAMADAN CEASEFIRE On Monday, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution that should have come into effect a long time ago. By a 14-0 vote, the international body demanded an immediate ceasefire for the month of Ramadan respected by all parties leading to a lasting sustainable ceasefire in Gaza, along with the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. (The full text of the order, known officially as Resolution 2728, is available here .) Importantly, the resolution does not call for a permanent ceasefire. In its press release , the United Nations notes that representatives of Russia objected to this, saying that they learned of a proposal to replace the word permanent in relation to a ceasefire in operative paragraph 1 with weaker wording approximately an hour before today s meeting. This last-minute maneuvering has resulted in a compromised resolution, only marginally better than the humanitarian pause that was ordered back in November , since there s nothing to prevent Israel from simply resuming its brutal assault on Gaza after Ramadan ends. It wouldn t even be a very long reprieve, as we re already more than halfway through the Islamic holy month, which began on March 10 and ends on April 9. In previous months, the United States has used its status as a permanent member of the Security Council to veto every proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza, overriding the opinion of the rest of the world on three separate occasions . (Future historians will look on each of those vetoes as an unforgivable crime.) This time, the United States merely abstained from voting, allowing Resolution 2728 to pass. It s a notable change in U.S. policy, and a sign that the efforts of pro-Palestinian protestors around the U.S. who have hounded Biden at public events and organized a surprisingly effective uncommitted protest vote against him may finally be breaking through.

STORIES THAT SHOULD BE BIGGER YOUR FOOD IS FULL OF PESTICIDES In the United States, most people probably have a vague idea that their fruits and vegetables get sprayed with pesticides before they reach the grocery store. But according to a new study, the sheer amount of toxic chemicals in our food is really staggering. In its 2024 Shoppers Guide to Pesticides in Produce, the nonprofit Environmental Working Group analyzed a huge set of testing data from the Department of Agriculture and the FDA, covering 47,510 samples of 46 fruits and vegetables. From that data, they identified a Dirty Dozen of 12 popular items including apples, strawberries, spinach, and other dark leafy vegetables which had the worst contamination levels. As Olivia Rosane writes for Common Dreams, the Dirty Dozen foods really were dirty, with around 95 percent of samples testing positive for some kind of chemical pesticide or fungicide. Among the chemicals found were diphenylamine , which is banned in the European Union over a possible link to cancer, neonicotinoids like acetamiprid which can harm children s nervous systems , and even borderline illegal compounds like acephate, which as Rosane notes with alarm is essentially prohibited for use on green beans but is still found on them, with one sample having levels 500 times the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) legal limit. Happily, there s also a Clean Fifteen list of produce items where little or no pesticide was detected, so all the carrot and asparagus fans out there should be safe. Still, this study shows that the United States safety and environmental regulations are nowhere near as strict as they need to be. From Issue 30 of Current Affairs Magazine, March/April 2021.

Unlike other large American cities facing housing affordability crises, Chicago does not have a dedicated revenue stream earmarked for fighting homelessness. Put forward by Chicago s new left-wing mayor Brandon Johnson, the Bring Chicago Home Initiative would seek to create one by taxing the most expensive real estate in the city. As Truthout reports, it would change the city s Real Estate Transfer Tax, currently a flat tax of .75 percent on all real estate purchases, to a graduated system, with a 0.6 percent tax on sales under $1 million, and a 2-3 percent progressive tax on sales over $1 million. Even with more than 68,000 residents experiencing homelessness according to the Coalition for the Homeless, Chicago spends a much smaller percentage of its budget helping the homeless than New York and Los Angeles. If passed, Bring Chicago Home would be Chicago s first crack at expanding its affordable housing stock since it abandoned the project in the 1990s and shifted towards a voucher system, which led to about 16,000 fewer units available for low-income families and wait times for public housing that can be as long as 25 years. According to a study from the University of Chicago s School of Public Policy, implementing the Bring Chicago Home s taxation structure could be expected to raise more than $160 million per year to put towards affordable housing. Bring Chicago Home has been met with a last-minute scare campaign promoted by the real estate industry, which has promised that it will raise housing costs for everyone, Anthony Perkins of the Coalition for the Homeless has disputed this: These are powerful political interests who for generations have raised rents, donated to landlord-friendly politicians and ferociously lobbied against any effort to tax any portion of their profits.

STORIES THAT SHOULD BE BIGGER PRIVATE EQUITY STRIKES AGAIN For NBC News , journalist Gretchen Morgenson has exposed a disturbing story of how private equity companies take over, and then systematically dismantle and ruin, vital public health and childcare services that affect thousands of people s lives. This is a trend that Aaron Wistar has previously written about for Current Affairs , mainly in the context of nursing and retirement homes. But as Morgenson reports, the equity firms are increasingly coming for autism services too. In 2018, the private equity company Blackstone purchased the Center for Autism and Related Disorders, a company that ran various schools and care centers around the country, as well as providing home therapy for children with autism. At its height, the company had 265 care facilities but by May 2023, more than 100 of them had closed, and the company had filed for bankruptcy . In the intervening years, the quality of care at CARD locations took a dramatic turn for the worse. For her article, Morgenson interviews Misty Richard the mother of a child named J.J. who went to a CARD clinic in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and hears firsthand how bad things got: J.J. came home one day agitated about thunderstorms, a deep-seated fear for him. The weather was clear, so Richard asked clinic officials if anything had happened with her son that day to stir his distress. After repeated emails asking for details that Richard said the clinic only reluctantly provided, she was shown a video of her son in a therapy session with a staffer flipping the lights on and off in the room, apparently to mimic lightning. In case it wasn t clear, this is definitely not something anyone is supposed to do with an autistic child. Apparently, the staffer responsible meant it as an emotional lesson for J.J. to identify what he was scared of, and after Misty Richard filed a complaint, they were disciplined by the Louisiana Behavior Ana",

Late last week, the House Energy and Commerce Committee unanimously approved a bill that would remove the Chinese-owned app from US app stores over claims that the Chinese government could use it to collect Americans data. Though the effort to ban TikTok has primarily been spearheaded by Republicans fearful that it is turning kids trans and making them worship Osama bin Laden , President Biden has signified that he would sign a ban, which could be on his desk as soon as Wednesday morning. Meanwhile, after supporting ban efforts in the past, Donald Trump abruptly changed his tune (presumably to this song ) over the weekend, coming out in defense of TikTok. Frankly, there are a lot of people on TikTok that love it, Trump said. There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it. He also added that it could increase the popularity of Facebook, which is an enemy of the people, along with a lot of the media.

It s certainly understandable that New Yorkers would be nervous to ride the subway after hearing about such attacks. But as we ve seen again and again, terrifying anecdotes are often used to create the impression that New York has become a crime-ridden sewer reminiscent of Taxi Driver . Last month, Alex Skopic explained in Current Affairs that shoplifting paranoia had more to do with sensational media coverage than actual stats. That is the case here. According to a New York Times analysis: Officials have spent millions to make New Yorkers transit riders feel safe. The investment is motivated more by passengers perception than by crime rates Although surveys by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the subway, show that a number of riders feel unsafe, data has not always confirmed the public s perception. Crime rates jumped during the coronavirus pandemic starting in 2020, but the subway became safer last year. In mid-2022, there was about one violent crime per one million rides on the subway, according to a New York Times analysis. Since then, the overall crime rate has fallen and ridership has increased, making the likelihood of being a victim",

Weeks before an ICE agent shot Renee Good dead in Minneapolis, the Department of Homeland Security in Washington warned about the dangers of confronting suspects in vehicles, according to a November memo leaked to me. For safe and effective vehicle extractions, de-escalation is key, cautioned an internal Customs and Border Patrol guidance, signed by the head of the agency s compliance directorate. Titled Guidance on Safe and Legally Compliant Vehicle Extraction Operations, the memo is referring to the same operation at the heart of the Renee Good killing: a vehicle extraction operation. That s what the ICE agents were trying to carry out and why they approached her vehicle in the first place, with one agent even reaching through the window and grabbing the car door. The term vehicle extraction normally refers to rescuing trapped occupants from a damaged vehicle. But DHS has its own belligerent definition: forcibly removing a suspect from their vehicle. To bolster its view that protestors are weaponizing vehicles, the Department has spun itself into crisis and confrontation mode, a contributing factor in Good s death and the spate of other incidents where federal law enforcement agents and officers have attempted vehicle extractions.

That s over one-third of the total number of countries in existence (193)! Effective January 21, the directive was signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio earlier today. Citing the Immigration and Nationality Act, the order claims concerns over immigrants being financially self-sufficient as the supposed reason for the freeze.

Operations Benchwarmer, Tidal Wave, Abracadabra, Dust Off, Fleur De Lis these are just a few of the secret programs recently undertaken by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE has become a self appointed bouncer for America under Donald Trump, enlisting tens of thousands of federal, state, and local police and intelligence departments and agencies to not just root out illegals, but also exploit them for intelligence, leaked documents show. A Border Patrol official outraged by ICE s conduct has leaked to me this and other documents providing an unprecedented glimpse into ICE s undeclared activities across the country. Many of these operations and their codenames have not been previously reported. A 15-page long document, marked LAW ENFORCEMENT SENSITIVE, details 21 different major ICE operations resulting, so it says, in 6,852 apprehensions since June. From Operation Abracadabra, a covert effort to develop informants among immigrants in detention, to Operation Benchwarmer, which alone spans the deployment of 2,000 intelligence assets across the country, the document gives a sense of how aggressively ICE is scouring neighborhoods and developing sources to spy on immigrants and Americans alike.

In the wake of an ICE officer s killing of Renee Good, the Department of Homeland Security is rolling out Operation Metro Surge, flooding Minneapolis with hundreds of additional federal agents only to realize it doesn t actually have the confidence to match the bravado. While homeland secretary Kristi Noem and others in the administration preen about justifying last week s shooting and trumpet their war on domestic terrorism, DHS is privately divided and hesitant about the latest deployments. According to documents leaked to me, not only is the Department seeking volunteers for the apparently unpopular mission, it is urging its agents to maintain a low profile and comply with the use of force policies. Border Patrol memo leaked to me On Friday, DHS sought volunteers to deploy to Minneapolis, in part due to opposition within the ranks, according to border patrol agents and other homeland security workers who have reached out to me. Please begin canvassing your personnel for volunteers, a memo sent by the Border Patrol s Acting Assistant Chief Joshua Andrew Post on Friday. The memo outlines a request for 300 additional personnel 200 Border Patrol Agents (BPAs) and 100 Processing Coordinators (BPPCs) to be funneled into Operation Metro Surge by Sunday, January 11.

I have obtained and am publishing here the two most central policy documents. They are bureaucratically dense and elastic to the extreme, offering every possible excuse for ICE s killing of Renee Good. But they are also stark in their failure to address any aspect of the dramatically new environment created by ICE s expanded mission. What they reveal is that the rules literally have not changed since Trump came into office. This despite the fact that homeland security has completely changed the conditions under which its agencies are operating in America, especially with the twisted claims that it is fighting domestic terrorism. The rules as they exist, however, say nothing about protesters, nothing about agents masking up or arming to the teeth, nothing about the arrogant behavior that leads to this chaos, nothing about domestic terrorism. I asked the Department of Homeland Security about the current rules. The agency s current use of force policy is the same as it was in 2023 under President Biden s administration, Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin responded. Thus, as confirmed by homeland security, ICE is operating under a set of use of force policy documents, last updated by Biden administration, documents that legally justify the killing.

Video of the incident shows several masked ICE agents approaching a vehicle that tries to speed away as one of the agents opens fire. Though ICE says the shooting was in self defense and President Trump claims that an ICE officer was run over, Minneapolis police say the woman appeared to just be blocking traffic. There were no warning shots, no attempts to deescalate whatsoever. Trump s post on Truth Social I am obviously very concerned that I have been told that a woman who was sitting in her car blocking the street and not the target of any enforcement activity is now deceased, said Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O Hara. The Police Chief continued: In any professional law enforcement agency in the country, I think they would tell you it s obviously very concerning whenever there s shooting into a vehicle of someone who is not armed. This is what we have come to: government agents out of control, a federal government agency that sees the American public as the enemy, and homeland security screaming domestic terrorism, creating the environment and the backdrop for those same government agents to be outnumbered of control. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey describes ICE s account of the incident and the agent s actions as bullshit. He calls on the agency to get the fuck out of Minneapolis while Governor Tim Walz readies his National Guard, under state control. It s likely we re about to hear a lot more about the incident in the coming days. But what you won t hear about is the role of Trump s national security directive NSPM-7 in all of this.

This is a reversal of Mamdani s earlier statement that the commissioner, within the structure of our city hall, will be reporting to our first deputy mayor, Dean Fuleihan. The headline of this story has been updated to reflect this change. Media coverage of Zohran Mamdani s first day in office glossed over his early exercise of mayoral power. My favorite example of the shallowness of the coverage is CNN s bombshell revelation that Mamdani was distributing hot chocolate at city hall, an image that trivializes him and the moment.

Help me keep doing this newsletter by becoming a paid subscriber On New Year s Eve, the Department of Homeland Security s X account posted an illustration of a 1960 s car parked on an idyllic beach. The caption I m not making this up is America After 100 Million Deportations. A casual reference to the forcible removal of over a quarter of the country (coming from the official account of a cabinet-level department of the U.S. government!) is, of course, insane. But there s a message behind the madness, as I quickly realized after looking up some of the latest polling on DHS. It turns out that DHS s vision of an imagined past resonates with quite a few people. Recent polling from Gallup finds that the Department is the only federal agency to see a significant increase in its job rating in 2025. But here s the kicker: Gallup also found a huge increase in Americans support for immigration (including among Republicans). So what explains the support for DHS but not its vision of mass deportation? Vision is the keyword here. People are sick of the realistic and the reasonable, because look at where it got us: houses you can t afford to buy and healthcare you can t afford to use. A mass immigration bringing back a 1960 s-era country isn t really what Americans want; it s the boldness of the idea that appeals to people. They want political leaders to think big. And what s bigger than 100 million? President Trump seems very aware of this, having taken up the occasion of the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence as an opportunity to impose his vision of where the country goes from here, with his typical penchant for grandiosity. He said in his New Year s address: 2026 will be a celebration of America like no other, honoring our nation and all of its glory Working with states, companies, and organizations across the country, we will renew the patriotism, pride, and pioneering spirit of America, and lay the groundwork for the next 25",

Help make ours happy too, by becoming a paid subscriber - it would mean the world to us! I m writing this on my flight back from a weeklong trip to the Galapagos Islands, where for the first time in years I was largely without access to the Internet. For someone as congenitally online as I am, this at first seemed a curse. It turned out to be far from that and has me questioning a lot of what I thought I knew about media, politics and, well, people. My Galapagos excursion took place on a boat with over a dozen other travelers. They were young and older, professors and small business owners (even an Army colonel!), Republicans and Democrats, from big cities and small towns. People from wildly different backgrounds readily shared sunscreen, snacks, even life advice. And while it wasn t partisan, it also wasn t apolitical: issues like the outrageous cost of housing, healthcare and childcare came up. Yet absent was the political vitriol that the national security state says necessitates a new domestic war on terrorism. Contrary to the national security threat machine s picture of a country at war with itself, we all got along so swimmingly that the idea of a civil war or anything like it struck me as laughable, as did the notion that the statistically insignificant number of politically-motivated killings, though real, said anything at all about the vast majority of real-world Americans. I say real-world to distinguish from the Internet, where anonymity and disembodied reality can lead to people saying things they never would in real life. The Galapagos are unique because its extreme remoteness has insulated various species from outside predators, providing Charles Darwin a controlled setting to observe and later theorize evolution. That same remoteness in my case from the constant intravenous drip of the internet and social media for the first time in maybe my entire adult life left me with the staggering realization tha",

Please return the favor by becoming a paid subscriber Readers here know about the FBI s new enemies list , a product of Trump s NSPM-7 policy that commenced the most aggressive program of domestic spying since 9/11. Readers of the New York Times and the Washington Post? Not so much. In September, Donald Trump signed the national security directive giving marching orders to some 250,000 federal law enforcement officers and intelligence analysts to target anti-American activity (as they define it). Then last week, the Justice Department directed the FBI to compile a list of Americans whose activities may constitute domestic terrorism, according to a memo I published this weekend. The administration also released last week its national security strategy that prioritizes defense of the homeland over every other challenge facing America. The Justice Department memo I published has elicited outrage across the political spectrum, but hardly any major news outlet can bother to even write about it and how law enforcement is now targeting speech and the basic activities that constitute American civic life. This is an object lesson in everything that s wrong with corporate media. It s particularly incredible for a story so creepy it seemed to write itself: a blacklist, a cash reward system for public cooperators, and a supercharged FBI tip line where anyone and everyone can tattle on their neighbors for anti-American thoughts and activities. Screenshot of DOJ memo One of the only media outlets that even wrote about the Justice Department order, Reuters, failed to mention some of the most alarming developments contained within it, instead focusing on what could be the only boring part of the entire document tax law and the IRS.

For more leaks and to make it so I can keep doing this work, please become a paid subscriber. Attorney General Pam Bondi is ordering the FBI to compile a list of groups or entities engaging in acts that may constitute domestic terrorism, according to a Justice Department memo published here exclusively. The target is those expressing opposition to law and immigration enforcement; extreme views in favor of mass migration and open borders; adherence to radical gender ideology, as well as anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism, and anti-Christianity. Bondi Memo On Countering Domestic Terrorism And Organized Political Violence 151KB PDF file Download Download That language echoes the so-called indicators of terrorism identified by President Trump s directive National Security Presidential Memorandum-7 , or NSPM-7, which the memo says it s intended to implement. Where NSPM-7 was a declaration of war on just about anyone who isn t MAGA, this is the war plan for how the government will wage it on a tactical level. In addition to compiling a list of undesirables, Bondi directs the FBI to enhance the capabilities (and publicity) of its tipline in order to more aggressively solicit tips from the American public on, well, other Americans. To that end, Bondi also directs the FBI to establish a cash reward system for information leading to identification and arrest of leadership figures within these purported domestic terrorist organizations. (The memo later instructs the FBI to establish cooperators to provide information and eventually testify against other members of the groups.) The payouts don t end there. Justice Department grants are now to prioritize funding to programs for state and local law enforcement to go after domestic terrorism. In a section titled Defining the domestic terrorism threat, the memo cites extreme viewpoints on immigration, radical gender ideology, and anti-American s",

Here s the kicker: there was evidently no breakthrough in the investigation. In fact, the FBI reportedly had the evidence in its possession all along. The FBI s case against the suspect is not based on a new breakthrough, according to two sources, but instead on a review the FBI conducted in recent weeks of evidence that had already been gathered and which the department had in its possession, MS NOW (previously MSNBC) reported this morning. That voluminous trove of material was largely collected in 2021 and 2022. In other words, the FBI had all the evidence it needed from the start but never bothered to go through it until now. That s the kind of failure that should lead to calls for resignations and investigations; but the major media are instead anointing the government agency as if it should be awarded a Nobel. That s not the FBI I know. The FBI I know undertook the COINTELPRO program from the 1950s through the Vietnam war that purported to target radical and subversive individuals and groups. The FBI I know targeted Martin Luther King Jr. and kept of dossiers on Americans from Albert Einstein to Marilyn Monroe. The FBI I know was so biased that their inattention to the Watergate scandals forced deep throat to go to the news media, a man who turned out to be a deputy director of the very agency. The FBI I know bungled high-profile investigations from the Anthrax attacks in 2001, the Centennial Olympic Park Bombing in 1996, the Parkland School Shooting in 2018 and its infamous mole, Special Agent Robert Hanssen.

    "text": "Why Hegseth's Alleged War Crime Will Never Be Revealed Lethal strike on alleged drug boat in Caribbean is shrouded in an above-top secret world Subscribe now We will never know the full truth about the Trump administration s military strikes in the Caribbean. That s because the attacks on alleged drug smuggling boats are taking place under a task force of the Joint Special Operations Command (or JSOC, pronounced jay-sock ). JSOC, which most famously controls the Army s Delta Force and the Navy s SEAL Team 6, lives in an above-top secret world parallel to the vanilla military, with its own chain of command, and often with its own set of rules. For many in the military, and even for experts, untangling JSOC operations is a near impossibility, even from wars going as far back as the first Gulf War in 1991. That s because Delta and SEAL Team 6, like other special operators, work covertly (often hand in hand with the CIA and foreign governments), the operators themselves lurking in the grey world of civilian cover and deniability, facilitating missions that the conventional military can t do. I ve confirmed with senior military and intelligence officers that SEAL Team 6 had the lead in the targeted killings of those aboard an alleged drug boat on September 2. The attack has in recent days been labeled a possible war crime by many in Congress. The controversy began when The Washington Post reported last week that War Secretary Pete Hegseth had ordered the military to carry out the September strike and Kill them all, as story s headline blared. The article alleges that military interpreted this directive such that, after an initial strike, a second was carried out to finish off two survivors a war crime, experts quoted in the story said. Congress is scheduled to receive a classified briefing from Admiral Frank Bradley, the new commander of Special Operations Command (SOCOM) who served as commander of JSOC during the September 2 attack.

Would mean the world to us if you could make the next year of this newsletter possible by becoming a paid subscriber Ken Until recently, Thanksgiving was to me a cynical joke. Mandated gratitude felt like a tall order in a world where so few have everything; not only money but even just the ability to have their voices heard. That s the greatest indignity of all: that most people have no voice while a select few boom so loud they penetrate our consciousness like a sound cannon. Buy this. Read that. Watch this. Think that. Be afraid of this person, this group, or idea. Oh, but assume a childlike adoration for the sanctioned savior. For years I tried to figure out how to hijack the major media sound cannon. Not to bark my own orders to voice a perspective that I knew countless other people shared but were permitted by media to express. At first I went through the front door, applying for jobs at conventional news outlets. I never heard back from a single one. Not even a no thanks. Just silence. Then I tried the back door. I took to social media to post documents I d unearthed through FOIA and other techniques. Finally the media took notice. Some even hired me. This was gratifying at first (your in-laws finally believing you have a job is nice, lol). But what I thought would finally give me a voice turned out to be some else s voice. The existing media ecosystem was mostly only interested in stories I found that could be used as fodder for whatever Washington battle was playing out that week and the bigwig officials involved. Even in their most trenchant reporting on such officials, the unspoken assumption is that they really are the authors of reality. I came to realize that institutions, not individuals, are what shapes people s lives. Under the tutelage of my now-editor Bill Arkin, it became painfully clear to me how far my own journalism fell short of not just mapping out what these institutions are doing, but also what normal people",

This in itself is a scandal. Since 9/11, tens of billions have been spent on keeping an eye on the nation s capital, on greater intelligence collection and analysis, on ever more surveillance and guards. The suspect, an Afghan national granted asylum in the U.S. after reportedly serving in a CIA-backed Afghan paramilitary unit, is a textbook profile of the very kind of attacker this sprawling, multibillion dollar national (and homeland) security apparatus is supposed to catch. The administration s response to what should be seen as a humiliating attack is to put more Guardsmen on the streets of DC and to beef up security and surveillance, their reflexive after-the-fact response to every one of their failures. Congress response has been to offer the Department of Homeland Security millions more in funding, according to one bipartisan proposal that is sure to be followed by other similar budget top-offs. All of this ignores the Everest-sized mountain of funding that these agencies already enjoy. What about the multi-billion dollar network of Joint Terrorism Task Forces that already exists in every city and state across America? What about the watchlisting apparatus? The National Counterterrorism Center, the Threat Screening Center, the DC Fusion Center, the interagency national capital this and that? What about the counterterrorism programs of the FBI, homeland security, CIA, NSA, the Pentagon and countless other civilian departments and agencies?

Subscribe now Zohran Mamdani and Donald Trump met in the White House on Friday and demonstrated a new kind of politics that actually stuck to policy. Through good-faith engagement they neutralized some of each other s concerns on hot button issues from the National Guard and ICE deployments to federal funding for New York. The major media couldn t see it, or didn t want to. They instead reduced the event to a buddy movie , lovefest or bromance , to quote them. Their accounts ignored how extraordinary it was that such polar opposite figures weren t just cordial but productive, as Trump described the meeting, on actual issues millions of Americans care about. Trump for the first time backed off his threats to send the National Guard into New York or withhold federal funding. Mamdani deflected any name-calling or hostility. The two managed to make New York the center of the event. We ve just had a great meeting, a really good, very productive meeting, Trump said in the Oval Office after a private discussion with Mamdani. We re gonna be helping him to make everybody s dream come true having a strong and very safe New York. Mamdani proved a skillful politician, not through smiles or charm but by engaging with Trump on issues of mutual interest. We had a meeting today that actually surprised me, Trump said. He wants to see no crime. In the Oval Office press event following their 25-minute private meeting, they pointed to public safety in particular as an area of shared interest. Mamdani signaled his willingness to cooperate with the federal government, including ICE, on certain serious crimes. Trump twice identified public safety as an issue they discussed at great length and more than any other issue. Per Trump: We re gonna make sure that if there s horrible people there, we want to get em out. I think he wants to get em out maybe more than I do. So we ll work together.

Its most successful game, Baldur s Gate 3 , is also one of the most critically acclaimed PC games. . . ever? I think? On the game distribution platform Steam, it has a mind-boggling 431,000 user reviews and an overwhelmingly positive tag. Professional critics feel similarly. It not only garnered a bunch of Best Game of 2023 awards, but quickly started popping up on a bunch of best games of all time lists. BG3 has sold more than 20 million units . This would be impressive for almost any game, but I think it s even more so in this case given that this isn t a game the average consumer can just download and start playing. It has a deep, complex system inspired by Dungeons & Dragons that takes a lot of time to learn. Not a perfect analogy, but this is sort of the equivalent of a dense, 800-page literary novel putting up the sorts of sales numbers normally associated with self-help hits. A lot of Larian s and BG3 s success stems from the premium the studio puts on storytelling, character development, and voice acting. That s part of the reason the studio s head, Adam Smith, made headlines in a recent Reddit Ask Me Anything. At one point he was asked about Larian s approach to generative AI as it builds its next game in the Divinity franchise. I think the only background everyone will need to understand this excerpt is that creative types are starting to use AI as placeholder text in various contexts, later replaced (supposedly!) by human-authored copy. Smith explained: We don t have any text generation touching our dialogues, journal entries, or other writing in Divinity. To answer your second question, how does generated placeholder text benefit development over simple stub text it doesn t. We had a limited group experimenting with tools to generate text, but the results hit a 3/10 at best and those tools are for research purposes, not for use in Divinity.

I will be honest: I read a couple of books on Cuba beforehand (I thought Ada Ferrer s was excellent), but I did not do nearly as much research as I should have prior to such an incredible travel opportunity. Work, life, et cetera. So going in, I wasn t sure how forthcoming Cubans would be with a goofy American who spoke toddler-level Spanish. The answer was: very. It was mostly our drivers we had the most in-depth conversations with. After the normal where-ya-from pleasantries our shared knowledge and touchpoints often centered on Florida I would try to tactfully and nonchalantly ask, like, Qu es la situaci n con la econom a? (not how a competent speaker would ask that question), [TKFN I m writing this from a library and as I was typing this sentence I overheard a kid starting a Spanish lesson.] and the drivers would often then go off, at length, about how absolutely screwed everything was. They mostly directed their ire at their own government. U.S. sanctions (which are ridiculous) did come up, but that just wasn t where they put the blame. They told stories about the massive numbers of people who have fled, the ridiculous bureaucracies they d endured, the corruption, the difficulty of getting basic goods.

The song s narrator is being preached to, but he is unimpressed. Unimpressed by what? Well, creation, for one thing cattle and the creeping things is from Genesis, from God laying out his whole groovy plan : And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.

He can barely get through the opening scenes of the Bible before saying, Yeah, yeah, I ve heard that before sounds good, but doesn t it all end rather poorly? He s more bored and jaded than inspired, let alone enraptured. Cattle and the Creeping Things was written by Finn and Tad Kubler, his longtime bandmate in both The Hold Steady and Lifter Puller .

These men belong to a sect that believes that it s a mitzvah, a good deed, to get less observant Jews to put on tefillin, which are black leather boxes containing parchment inscribed with verses from the Torah. You wear one on your arm and one on your head I think the last time I did this was during my bar mitzvah. They ll go up to possibly Jewish men and ask, Are you Jewish? Because I have a large, crooked nose, whenever I run in the park, these Jews home in on me like ducks chasing an anthropomorphic sack of bread crumbs. This triggers insecurities I thought I had conquered long ago. I m otherwise over my nose. It was women I d always been most concerned about, but over time I realized that some women perverts are into noses like mine, and others are willing to overlook it because I have developed so many other positive qualities, though I am precluded by space constraints from listing any of them here.

Now, the world s poorest populations are heavily concentrated in Africa where, unfortunately, economic growth has been slower. The poorest countries don t just contain a large number of poor people in most, an extremely large fraction of their population is poor.

There s an annoyingly young and talented writer and philosopher named Matthew Adelstein, a.k.a. Bentham s Bulldog , who is worth reading, even perhaps especially when you think his arguments are weird. Recently, he stuck his hand into a hornet s nest called continental philosophy. First came a post titled How Continental Philosophers Argue. Here s a key early bit: For those who don t know, continental philosophy is a particular strain of philosophy that grew out of Europe and was tragically imported to America. Prominent authors include Hegel, Sartre, Butler, and Heidegger. While analytic philosophers strive to be clear, continental philosophers don t; as Michael Huemer says Continental writers are generally much less clear about what they re saying than the analytic philosophers. They won t, e.g., explicitly define their terms before proceeding. They use more metaphors without any literal explanation, and they use more idiosyncratic, abstract jargon. If you read continental philosophy, you ll notice something strange about the jargon. The prose will be unintelligible; the stylistic equivalent of tar. While you suspect that the author is under the impression that they re making an argument, and there are some words present that suggest that they are engaged in the arguing enterprise (e.g. thus, therefore, etc), you have no clue what the argument is supposed to be, and suspect that if the author was forced to put their argument in premise conclusion format, they could not do so. You suspect similarly that if you got five different readers, and asked them the number of premises in the argument, you may very well get five different answers. Adelstein argues that while continental philosophy doesn t really make arguments, what it does isn t altogether different from making argument[s]. It s a hideous admixture of literary analysis, gibberish, and argument. They start by saying some things, then say other things that they suggest follow from the earlier things, and have",

    "text": "I Hate Journalism’s Culture Of Casual Calumny This isn t what we re supposed to be doing Earlier this week, Taylor Lorenz sent out a newsletter accusing Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares of being anti-AI grifters. It neatly captures a style of journalism that drives me crazy. Lorenz s newsletter begins: On Friday, there was a big event in L.A. for a widely-panned book supposedly critiquing the AI industry called If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies by Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soare s . I don t cover the nuances of the AI industry much, but the PR person for the book invited me and I said sure. I and a few other tech reporters RSVPd and received confirmation that we d be attending. A few days later, however, the PR person called and said, actually, I was DISINVITED for being too critical of Silicon Valley. Apparently my reporting on tech billionaires had angered the organizers. I thought this was pretty wild. I m broadly critical of Silicon Valley, but I m also very pro-technology, especially compared to others on the left. I believe in a better world through technology, just not technology controlled by the current class of Silicon Valley billionaires. I ve never been disinvited from a book event for my tech criticism, and myself and a bunch of tech journalists laughed about it. It was very silly for the organizers of this party to invite and then disinvite Lorenz; they re basically asking for negative coverage, and Lorenz has every right to go public about this strange turn of events. What bothers me is the way Lorenz can t just tell the story, but seems intent on inflicting maximum reputational damage on Yudkowsky, Soares, and other people in their orbit she just takes every last possible swipe at this crew, many of them unfair. This is part of what I call the culture of casual calumny in journalism, and it really sucks. The CCC is a style of journalism and punditry (these days, the two bleed into one another more often than not, including in this newsletter) that is very attack-dog, very fuck these guys , very quick to render judgment and to privileg",

    "text": "Is It Okay To Call Jeffrey Epstein An Ephebophile? (This headline will get screenshot and posted to Bluesky) Megyn Kelly, Patton Oswalt, and a woodchipper sounds like the start of a particularly distasteful joke, but instead, these are the core components of a controversy that popped off on Bluesky, America s kindest and gentlest social-media platform , over the weekend. It started when, during an episode of her SiriusXM show last week , with Batya Ungar-Sargon as a guest, Kelly said this about Jeffrey Epstein. The part I m bolding went viral: Kelly: As for Epstein, I ve said this before, but just as a reminder: I do know somebody very, very close to this case who is in a position to know virtually everything. Not everything, but virtually everything. And this person has told me from the start, years and years ago, that Jeffrey Epstein, in this person s view, was not a pedophile. This is this person s view, who was there for a lot of this. But that he was into the barely legal type. Like, he liked 15-year-old girls. And I realize this is disgusting. I m definitely not trying to make an excuse for this I m just giving you facts. That he wasn t into, like, 8-year-olds, but he liked the very young teen types that could pass for even younger than they were, but would look legal to a passerby. And that is what I believed and that was what I reliably was told for many years. And it wasn t until we heard from Pam Bondi that they had tens of thousands of videos of alleged forgive me, they used to call it kiddie porn, now they call it child sexual abuse material on his computer that for the first time I thought, oh, no, he was an actual pedophile. I mean, only a pedophile gets off on young children abuse videos. She s never clarified it. I don t know whether it s true. I have to be honest. I don t really trust Pam Bondi s word on the Epstein matters anymore. Ungar-Sargon: Or anything else. [laughing] Kelly: Yeah. So I don t know what s true about him, but we have yet to see anybody come forward and say, I was a like a I was under 10. I was under 14 when I first came within his purv",

    "text": "The Great Feminization Theory Has A Lot Of Soft Spots (Part 2) One fairly robust, consistent finding from social psychology is that conservatives are more sensitive to disgust than liberals. When it comes to anything involving germs or infection or impurity, conservatives, on average, are going to respond more viscerally. That s why, after the pandemic broke out in 2020, we saw everything break down along sadly predictable political lines. Republicans, activated by their higher-than-average fear of disease, quickly embraced harsh lockdown policies, masks, and vaccine mandates. Some of these policies, in retrospect, may have done more harm than good. But Democrats didn t cover themselves in glory, either: First, they exhibited shockingly little concern for the fact that we were, in fact, in the early stages of a global pandemic. They protested even the early, less controversial lockdown measures and later refused to get vaccinated. Many of them became hardened deniers that there even was a pandemic, that the vaccines worked, or both. Wait, I ve got that all entirely backward: On average, it was liberals who were way more worried about the virus, and conservatives who were, almost from the start, skeptical of it. How can we explain that, in light of the available research? Because life is not a lab. It s very easy to generate effects in experimental studies that just don t generalize to the real world. The disgust findings are real, but that doesn t mean that they can be neatly translated onto real-world situations involving disease or disgust. Which tribes adopt which beliefs is so complex and overdetermined that psychology experiments are very unlikely to provide us with sufficient insight to predict this sort of thing before the fact. Translating Average-Level Group Differences Into Explanations for Real-World Outcomes Is Difficult A cople weeks ago I laid out some background that I think helps to put the argument over the feminization of society and particularly academia in the proper context. In this post I m going to respon",

    "text": "If You Can’t Accurately Quote Someone, Why Should I Believe Anything You Write? Example #234234234 of intellectual rot in left-of-center spaces For a while, I ve been concerned about what feels like creeping intellectual rot in left-of-center circles . This rot is by no means ubiquitous, and there are plenty of liberal and leftist writers whose work I still respect, enjoy, and learn from. But in many cases, arguments are published that fail to clear extremely basic, very low bars the equivalent of pulling a muscle during warm-ups before getting to the actual exercise itself. It s very common for writers in this space to fail to accurately sum up the views of their opponents, to misstate basic facts of a given case, to quote in deeply disingenuous ways, and to make arguments that simply don t hold water in a freshmen composition, A-implies-B sense. In many cases, rhetorical Calvinball is replacing sound thinking. A couple days ago Literary Hub , a well-regarded lefty arts publication that often publishes political takes, ran an article by Peter Coviello , the former chair of Africana Studies at Bowdoin College and currently a professor at the University of Illinois Chicago. Coviello s article is about how, after former Bowdoin African Studies major Zohran Mamdani hit the spotlight, Coviello started getting inquiries from journalists asking what he remembered about him. (Coviello writes that he s not sure he ever had Mamdani as a student, but might have.) This part stuck out at me: Beneath its humdrum requests, every email said more or less the same thing: Can you explain how reading certain things can turn a person into a socialist and, possibly, a terrorist-sympathizing antisemite ? It s a storied gambit of the right at its most grimly predictable. People read Foucault, the redoubtable David Brooks once wrote, in an actual column that I ve all but committed to memory, and develop an alienated view of the world. God, did I love this. An alienated view of the world ! Not by, like, trying to pay rent or having an insurance claim denied no, no, it was probably the Foucault you read in 2003. Anyway, it was clear",

    "text": "It’s Hard To Explain To Normal, Healthy People What Just Happened To Blue Jays Fans Being a die-hard sports fan makes no freaking sense Back in the fall of 2003 the Red Sox, who at the time hadn t won a World Series since 1918, were making a deep run. So deep, in fact, that they were one Game 7 away from the World Series. Not only that, but the team standing in our way yes, our way was our archrival, the New York Yankees. Red Sox-Yankees is supposed to be one of the most intense rivalries in sports, but for years it was a rather lopsided one. During our nearly century-long drought, the Yankees racked up TWENTY-SIX World Series titles . So by the time the 2003 American League Championship Series began, the rivalry meant a hell of a lot more to us than it did to them. I was attending Brandeis University at the time. I tagged along with a high school friend and some other kids to go watch Game 7 on a big screen in a large auditorium at Boston University, probably because we just wanted to watch in a large crowd and mostly couldn t get into bars (Boston takes, or at least took, a Stasi-like attitude toward underage drinking, in terms of carding policies). A lot of New York kids come to Boston for college, so unfortunately, while the auditorium was mostly Sox fans, there was a large contingent of Yankees fans in the back. Mostly sex offenders, I can only assume. I am no longer a big Red Sox fan. Baseball was always my third-favorite sport to watch, behind the NFL and NBA (outside of hockey, which I don t really watch, college sports barely exist in the Boston sports universe), and as I got older I found I just didn t have it in me to keep up. Back then, though, I was, like perhaps a million other greater Boston residents, deeply invested in the 2003 Red Sox. We had our stars: Anyone with even a passing awareness of recent baseball history will remember Pedro Martinez (watching him pitch was a sui generis experience as a sports fan), Manny Ramirez (one of the top hitters of his era, as well as a bit of a wildman Manny being Manny was a catchphrase back then when he did something weird, like disappear into",

    "text": "You Can’t Understand ‘Feminization’ Discourse Without Understanding The Stunted And Censorious Nature Of Sex-Differences Research This isn t just about a viral conservative fad Many institutions that used to be dominated by men are now at gender parity, or even majority-female. This is particularly true in academia. How will this change these institutions? More importantly, how will it change society? The recent spate of discussion over feminization or the great feminization includes some actual research on this question and a lot of searingly hot takes. Let s try to separate the wheat from the chaff. The current surge of interest in this issue apparently started with a speech Helen Andrews gave at the National Conservatism Conference in September. She adapted it into an essay in Compact that spread far and wide or far and wide enough, at least, that David French wrote a critical response to it for his New York Times newsletter. Andrews cited an article the social psychologists Cory Clark and Bo Winegard wrote on this subject for Quillette in 2022 . Clark has also published academic research on the question. Richard Hanania is very skeptical and ties the shoddy reasoning (as he sees it) animating feminization claims to broader problems with anti-intellectualism on the right. I won t leave you in suspense: While I think it s well and good to highlight sizable sex differences in attitudes and behavior and to speculate about what they might mean as institutions become more female, I find a lot of the theorizing going on here bizarre. In many cases, proponents of the feminization theory (theories, really) are making the exact same sorts of leaps of logic and wildly overconfident claims they d usually accuse woke researchers of making. But I want to put this controversy into context. Because part of what makes this an interesting story is that academia, on the whole, has not done a good job taking sex differences seriously. In certain ways, the present proponents of feminization theory simply reflect the pendulum swinging back and wildly overshooting a reasonable center point. So all of this is easier to understand if we zoom out to better unde",

    "text": "The Complex Calculations Underpinning Slacker Chatbots Or: Why ChatGPT politely declined one of my requests OpenAI makes billions of dollars a year. How many billions is up for debate. OpenAI is printing money right now, noted Yahoo Finance last week, drawing on (paywalled) reporting in the Financial Times . The company is pulling in roughly $13 billion in annual revenue[.] Ed Zitron called for skepticism back in August , noting that OpenAI (and Anthropic) are cherry-picking numbers to make them seem far more successful than they really are, and giving them credit for revenue they are yet to book. I am not in a position to evaluate this claim other than to say that it would not shock me. Whether the true revenue answer is closer to $13 billion or $3 billion, it isn t nearly enough. Because OpenAI spends so much money on so many things, and because it is valued at about $500 billion , it is going to need to make much more money in the years to come in order to become truly viable, financially speaking. This is a story for another day, and probably for another author, but the question of OpenAI s long-term viability might have profound consequences for. . . well, for the whole country and maybe even the world. I found this YouTube video by Hank Green interesting (even if I felt unqualified to evaluate the argument itself). The short version is pretty simple: Right now, the biggest publicly traded company in the world, by market cap , is Nvidia (over $4 trillion). Nvidia sells GPUs, the chips that power AI, to OpenAI and various other major AI players. The major AI players are happy plowing billions into these chips because they believe they will create AI programs that will make a lot of money. There s still plenty of time for this to happen, and a million ways it could happen, but if people start to get scared that it won t happen, and if demand for Nvidia chips cools, well. . . given how central Nvidia has become to the economy, things could get ugly. One small but (I would argue) philosophically rich slice of this has to do with effort . Right now, OpenAI s money mostly",
