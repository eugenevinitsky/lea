    "text": "Aristotelian Intelligence Perception is all you need. I just finished reading Deborah Modrak's excellent (and difficult) book Aristotle: The Power of Perception . Modrak's project in that book is to demonstrate that one can extract a coherent philosophy of mind and a coherent epistemology from the Aristotelian corpus, and that both are based on Aristotle's integrated model of perceptual activity and (in the case of humans) thinking, or noetic, activity. Apart from the book's contribution to our understanding of Hellenistic philosophy of mind (Julia Annas' book on the philosophy of mind of the Stoics and the Epicureans should be mentioned here as well), it is also valuable as a conceptual framework for thinking about artificial intelligence (or, more narrowly, about the interplay between perception, pattern recognition, learning, and knowledge). Viewed from this angle, Aristotle's thought looks remarkably modern and can offer some new insights for both analysis and synthesis of AI systems. Generative and architectural thinkers It will be useful to frame the discussion that follows in terms of the dichotomy between generative vs. architectural style of reasoning, proposed in the context of AI by Philip Agre in Computation and Human Experience . According to Agre, generative theories &#8230; involve mathematical operations capable of generating an infinite number of mental structures by the repeated application of a small number of basic rules while architectural reasoning attempts not merely to implement a given abstraction but to discover abstractions that both do the required work and admit of natural implementations. Herbert Simon, Alan Newell, and Noam Chomsky are generative thinkers, whereas Marvin Minsky (when he wrote The Society of Mind ) is an architectural thinker. The core distinction between generativists and architecturalists hinges on the role of abstraction: The generative and architectural styles of research have led to different views about the relationship between abstraction and implementation in human",

    "text": "Our Preoccupation With Protein Intake The data on high protein diets, bars, supplements, and powders will surprise you I listened to T he Daily podcast this week, \"How America Got Obsessed With Protein ,\" which helped explain how this macronutrient frenzy has progressed to an unprecedented fever, but also had significant errors. While I had written about this topic in SUPER AGERS, it was time to review all the data available, for both efficacy and safety, of high protein intake. That's what this edition of Ground Truths is about. I will come back to this important Figure below later in the post, f rom an important study in both mice and people, demonstrating that high protein intake accelerated atherosclerosis and increases cardiovascular risk , and provided the underlying mechanism. In contrast, The Daily podcast stated: \"Well, it's unlikely that eating too much protein is actually going to harm you. Unless you have a specific kidney issue, we can eat a lot of protein. And it's not going to be bad for you.\" It turns out there's no shortage of data to refute that assertion made by the New York Times (which produces The Daily ). Let's get into this topic by answering 3 questions: What is driving the protein obsession? What are the data for high protein intake health benefits? What are the safety concerns regarding high protein consumption? Share Ground Truths 1. Driving The Protein Obsession The most recent published 2024 International Food Information Council annual survey of Americans found that 71% want to increase their protein intake, more than any other dietary constituent or vitamin. That number for protein was 52% in the 2022 survey. The number of Google searches for \"high protein\" peaked in 2025 . It's no wonder. Social media is chock full of protein promoters. A search of TikTok for \"200 grams of protein a day\" gets dozens of instructional videos. A survey of non-professional athletes taking protein supplements found that 40% get their information from social media. The Daily asserted that there are two main influencers driving the high protein craze: \"So the protein is goi",

    "text": "What Agency Means in the Era of Automation We’ve reached the end of 2025! Matt Fussell. Technology and The Arts-The Need for an Educational Revolution. We've reached the end of 2025! Thank you all for the kindness, support, and generosity you've shown me this year. In the past year, I saw the number of subscribers double for this newsletter as thousands of you read and shared my musings about AI and education. For that, I am truly humbled. Before launching into a year-end list that has filled many an inbox, let me begin with one final thought as we prepare for 2026. There Is No Keeping Up With AI Andrej Karpathy, one of the founders of OpenAI, cannot keep pace with developments related to AI and coding within his field. Neither can I for education. I don't think anyone can. Just a few months ago, Karpathy was publicly telling people he believed current agentic models weren't capable or \"there yet ,\" and has now shifted to feeling hopelessly behind. Claude's Opus 4.5 changed his perspective rapidly. If even the architects of these systems feel adrift, our goal for students cannot be mere technical fluency; it must be the cultivation of human agency. Teaching Agency and Resilience The skills students and educators need right now aren't AI-related in nature and cannot easily be taught through certification or so-called upskilling. That's because they're human. The chorus calling for education to remake itself in this age of automation misses a fundamental truth about what AI represents to learning, namely redefining tasks isn't the answer. It doesn't matter how fun, exciting, or engaging you make a curriculum, or how challenging you make an assessment; machine intelligence can now automate it. A student can task an AI to save them time and offload the practical struggle necessary to learn, so we need to talk about purpose, not product. We need to radically depart from learning as a series of tasks into a value-driven model that helps students form complete and messy pictures of themselves and allows them to navigate complicated systems.

    "text": "A unilateral change to childhood vaccines: What it means for you And why it matters Well, he did it. He actually did it. RFK Jr. unilaterally made sweeping changes to the routine vaccination schedule for children in the United States. This change isn't based on new data or new evidence, but rather on political and ideological reasons. He bypassed every scientific and clinical process we have, including not taking public comment. It is one of the most opaque and destabilizing public health decisions I've seen-it could blow up a lot of progress in childhood vaccines, which have been one of the most successful public health interventions in history. In its wake there will be confusion among parents, schools, and hospital systems, disruption of clinical workflows, possibility of increased liability, and complications with school vaccine requirements. The result is painfully predictable: fewer children will be vaccinated, and children will be harmed. This is overwhelming, but we are far from powerless. So let's dig into: What the heck just happened? Why is this shift a problem if other countries do it? What does it mean for you? And, what can be done about it? What the heck just happened? RFK Jr. directed the CDC Acting Director to formally update the U.S. childhood immunization schedule, effective immediately, to the following: The CDC will now routinely recommend vaccines for 11 diseases instead of 17. Several vaccines previously recommended for all children are now: Limited to high-risk groups. Left to \"shared clinical decision-making.\" RFK Jr. is moving away from population-level prevention and toward individualized risk assessment. This is a fundamental shift in how the U.S. has protected vulnerable groups, how families are guided, and how parents will be asked to make decisions. That shift matters. A lot. Why is this a problem? It's like going off-roading in a Porsche The administration's justification for this shift relies on comparisons to \"peer countries\" that recommend fewer vaccines. Denmark protects against 10 diseases, Germany 15, and Japan",

    "text": "AI: Samsung vs Apple global 'AI' smartphone race RTZ #958 ...world loves global AI distribution via Smartphone races Looks like Google Gemini AI is getting a distribution boost from Samsung Galaxy smartphones and devices that is bigger than might be understood. The reason this is important is of course the market fixation in this AI Tech Wave on the OpenAI vs Google LLM AI chatbot race. And the underlying global smartphone races that will now drive them. These are the kinds of races the world loves. And the fact that 2026 is the year of competition via DISTRIBUTION between the major LLM AI companies. Not just in the technical features of the underlying LLM AIs and chatbots that's been the primary driver of this race thus far. OpenAI is said to have 900 million weekly users of its GPT/ChatGPT 5.2 and earlier versions of AI services. That compares with a recent number of 650+ million for Google Gemini 3 and earlier versions . I'm on record with my 2026 AI Predictions on our AI Ramblings podcast, that Google with Gemini AI powering its global Google Search Services could reach 2 billion or more mainstream users, by year-end 2026. Samsung at CES 2026 announced their plans to boost Google Gemini distribution this year and beyond, and the numbers are interesting to say the least. Reuters lays it out in \" Samsung to double AI mobile devices to 800 million units this year\" : \"Samsung's mobile devices with \"Galaxy AI\" features will double to 800 mln units this year, co-CEO says\" \"Galaxy AI is powered by Google's Gemini, Samsung's own Bixiby assistant\" \"Co-CEO says Samsung not immune to \"unprecedented\" memory chip shortage\" The key item of course is the first point, which is a Samsung flex of its &#8216;Galaxy AI' Smartphones vs Apple's iPhone line-up. Now both phones are featuring Gemini AI as their underlying LLM AI chatbot technology. \"Samsung Electronics plans to double this year the number of its mobile devices with \"Galaxy AI\" features largely powered by Google's Gemini, its co-CEO said, which would give the U.S. firm an edge over rivals as the global race in artificial intelligence h",

The United States Senate is set to vote on a war powers resolution that would block further military action in Venezuela, while the House will vote on extending ACA subsidies and on overriding Donald Trump's first two vetoes of his term. Meanwhile, articles of impeachment against Kristi Noem are expected to be filed following yesterday's horrific shooting in Minnesota. Protests are growing today after the killing of Renee Nicole Good. I spent the overnight hours watching how several media outlets described the events in Minnesota, and I was deeply disheartened. While some continue to minimize or sanitize what is happening in our country, I will not.

This is Minnesota: This is Alaska: This is Wisconsin: Video analysis of the fatal Minneapolis ICE shooting shows Renee Nicole Good was driving away from officers when an agent fired multiple shots, contradicting Trump administration claims that the shooting was an act of self-defense against an oncoming vehicle and raising further questions about the handling of the scene and denial of immediate medical aid. Rep. Robin Kelly announced plans to introduce multiple articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem-accusing her of obstruction of justice, violating public trust, and self-dealing-after an ICE officer fatally shot a woman in Minneapolis, a killing the Trump administration defended",

Former Tory MP Ben Howlett is meeting an important new client. &#8216;Ross' is a British advisor to a wealthy Chinese investor with interests in AI and healthcare. Howlett is visibly relaxed. Perched on a leather chair below a high vaulted ceiling, the 39-year-old explains how he can facilitate political access and gather intelligence in Westminster for his dining companion. \"I can do it from a governmental point of view and I can also do it from a Labour point of view as well. Or I can do it from a Conservative point of view, whichever way you want to do it,\" he tells Ross. Howlett talks up his political connections. He has met Keir Starmer and senior Labour ministers in recent months. He knows how Westminster works. At one point, he jokes: \"I'm like that Nigerian guy on the internet, working out who's a stupid person but basically in the world of politics.\" Howlett's company, the Chamber Group, doesn't advertise that it sells political access to commercial clients. Nevertheless Howlett will soon introduce Ross to a raft of Labour MPs and even contact ministers on his behalf. They will give their opinions on everything from UK-China trade relations and foreign investment policy to data centres and industrial strategy. But what nobody knows is that Howlett's new paying client Ross is not the British face of a moneyed Chinese investor. He's actually an undercover reporter working for Democracy for Sale and Led By Donkeys. Democracy for Sale is a reader-supported publication. Consider becoming a paid subscriber to support our work.

Photo by Alexander Shatov on Unsplash Need another reason to leave X, formerly known as Twitter? If the Great Replacement conspiracy theories and the constant barrage of personal abuse weren't enough, this might tip you over the edge. Elon Musk's AI tool Grok is being used &#8211; en masse &#8211; to generate intimate images of real women and girls, some under 18, digitally undressed and shared online. Victims include celebrities, teenagers, and everyday female users &#8211; and despite the uproar, and mealy-mouthed words from Grok and Musk, the practice appears to be continuing, even as I write this. In a sentence that feels grimly predictable to write: this mass proliferation of sex abuse material has been framed as a technical failure. Loyal to the Silicon Valley \"move fast and break things\" ethos, Grok treated it as a lapse in safeguards, a moderation oversight, something that could be fixed with a technical patch. But this misses the point. This not some malfunction, but true to the platform's purpose: X is a mechanism that strips away our humanity and amplifies society's worst instincts. Racism, misogyny, and sexualised cruelty were not invented by social media, but they are increasingly defined by it. Anonymity, algorithms, and consequence-free posting do more than allow harmful attitudes to surface; they reward their performance. Users are repeatedly shown they are not alone in their worst impulses. Transgression brings attention and community, while moral restraint carries little reward.

Still, there was a method to their madness-and we saw much of it coming. Since Abortion, Every Day 's predictions for 2025 proved to be unfortunately prescient, we're doing it again: you'll find predictions from both of us below, with a few wishlist items for good measure. A theme runs through both of our lists: 2026 will be a big year for conservatives showing us who they are. It will be a year without nuance, pretense, or shame.

Become one &#11015;&#65039; Subscribe to PN An Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed Renee Good, age 37, in broad daylight in Minneapolis yesterday. Despite Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blathering about how ICE agents are under assault and President Donald Trump's outright fiction that Good ran over the agent and put him in the hospital, anyone with eyes can see it was murder. There's video, which is how we all know that DHS and Trump are lying, but seeing someone get murdered by the government is not an easy thing to watch. MPR News posted the footage, but this is just a reminder that you don't have to subject yourself to the horror to know it is a horror. What you see on the video it is a federal agent demanding Good get out of the car, at which point she starts driving her SUV forward at about five miles per hour. That's when an ICE agent near the front of her car fires multiple shots into Good's vehicle, killing her. In another video - which, again, is really tough to watch - a bystander yells that he's a physician and asks to render aid, to which the agent responds, \"I don't care.\" So what we have here is a federal law enforcement officer firing into a car at an unarmed person driving away slowly, and then other federal officers refusing to let someone come to her aid. It's absolutely terrible and a disgrace to our nation. But can the officer who killed Good ever be held accountable for his actions? A note from Aaron: Working with brilliant contributors like Lisa takes resources. If you aren't already a paid subscriber, please become one to support our work &#128071; Charges would have to be brought by the state Let's dispense with the possibility that ICE or DHS or the Department of Justice would do anything about this.

There's greed&#8230; and then there's the nauseating greed of profiteering corporations that make a killing &#8211; literally &#8211; by knowingly contaminating people's water, air, land, and families. Such rank, moral corruption is hard to fathom... but it's not hard to find. For one breathtaking example, consider Freeport-McMoRan . Support indie journalism: upgrade today This global mining behemoth is one of America's most aggressive spoliers of land, air, water, and health &#8211; including from its sprawling copper smelter near Phoenix, Arizona. This operation is a major spreader of lead pollution, a neurotoxin that's particularly harmful to children, causing pain, seizures, and learning disabilities. But wait, where's our Environmental Protection Agency ? Good question. In fact, until last year, EPA was requiring Freeport to install technology to cut those poisonous emissions. The giant squealed like a stuck pig, though, crying that the $60 million cost for the lifesaving equipment was too \"burdensome \" &#8211; even though that wouldn't even be a drop in Freeport's $2-billion-a-year bucket of profits. Sure enough, in October, Trump's new EPA honcho rushed to provide pollution protection. Not for the children, but for the polluter! Indeed, Trump's corporate-coddling agency \"super-streamlined\" the regulatory process by essentially eliminating it &#8211; no public hearing required, no presentation of facts, to chance for victims to object. All Freeport had to do was send an email requesting regulatory relief, and &#8211; BAM! &#8211; Trump promptly exempted its Arizona smelter from having to clean up its act. Not only is this \"free pass to pollute\" a blunt proclamation of corporate rule, it also expresses Trump's deep contempt for working-class people. Imagine if that smelter was in Florida, poisoning the elites in his Mar-a-Lago resort. Then, he'd jump on it like a gator on a poodle. Do something!

But the former British prime minister isn't just an AI evangelist advising governments on how they should use AI. He's now getting in on the tech bro act himself. We can today report that Blair's eponymous think tank has been spending heavily on developing its own AI tools that it hopes to sell to governments in what insiders describe as a bid to \"rival Palantir\".

Multiple sources confirmed that TBI has set up a new in-house \"AI Incubator\" in a bid to \"get on the AI bandwagon\", while cutting staff in other areas and posting financial losses. TBI was made aware of all points in this article prior to publication but declined to comment. Democracy for Sale is a reader-supported publication. If you aren't already, consider becoming a paid subscriber to support us. The AI Incubator, where top earners reportedly make up to &#163;370,000, is developing tools to help political leaders make decisions, with plans to sell them to governments clients, particularly authoritarian Gulf states, according to insiders. The move has caused internal concern, with some saying it is \"insane\" for a non-profit to try to compete with major tech companies. But \"Blair sees the Incubator as his legacy,\" one former employee said. Senior leadership at TBI are said to be hoping that the AI Incubator, which was launched last Spring, can transform the non-profit entity into a tech company. The Incubator is not expected to be offered as a competitor to OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude",

By Peter Geoghegan, May Bulman and Lucas Amin Tony Blair looked smaller somehow. Seated alone on a huge Dubai stage with ranks of political leaders filling the auditorium in front of him at the World Governments Summit in February, he sounded hoarse as he introduced his patron. Looming over him on a giant screen was Larry Ellison, founder of Oracle, the company whose share price in September briefly made him the richest man in the world. Now 81, Ellison remains a figure of fascination and intrigue in Silicon Valley, and just as monomaniacal as ever in his drive to remake the world. When Ellison's first biography appeared in 1997, it was titled: The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison: *God Doesn't Think He's Larry Ellison . In the years since, Ellison's fortune has ballooned to almost $400bn, bringing him close to his good friend Elon Musk. At the conference in Dubai, Ellison began with a joke about Musk before warning the audience that artificial super-intelligence was coming sooner than expected. What, Blair asked him, should governments be doing about it? \"The first thing a country needs to do is unify all of their data so that it can be consumed and used by the AI model,\" Ellison responded. Ellison was also specific about which data needed unifying &#8211; and he had an example in mind: \"The NHS in the UK has an incredible amount of population data,\" he declared, but it was too \"fragmented\" at present. Below him, the former prime minister nodded, clutching his Tony Blair Institute (TBI) notebook. Subscribe now Two weeks later, the TBI published a report entitled \"Governing in the Age of AI: Building Britain's National Data Library\". In it, Blair's organisation echoed Ellison on the UK's data infrastructure, calling it \"fragmented and unfit for purpose\".

News broke late last year that striking workers at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette were headed back to the office after more than three years since they first walked out of the newsroom in 2022. Members of the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh-CWA returned to work in November as victors in a grueling multi-year struggle with Block Communications-the longest strike in the history of U.S. newspapers and of any Pittsburgh industry. The U.S. Court of Appeals had ordered the company to resume bargaining a new union contract allowing workers and management to move forward with a clean slate. The family-owned Block Communications has now blocked the possibility. Mere hours after the U.S. Supreme Court denied the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's request to stay the November ruling, the owners of the nearly 240-year-old newspaper announced on Wednesday that they would be shutting it down entirely come May.

Stanford have published a report into myocarditis from covid vaccines. The findings are in line with a host of other respectable papers. Vaccine induced myocarditis is rare, Stanford found the symptoms are generally mild and cause no lasting damage, however in a small number of these rare occurrences the effects can be more serious. Stanford also state that covid is much worse, roughly 10 times as likely to cause myocarditis, in addition to the other trouble it causes, including inflammation which Stanford say is the cause of more serious myocarditis. This is yet another paper that concludes the risks of covid are worse than vaccination. Yet the reporting of this paper has led to a number of misleading headlines, even if in some cases the reality is briefly mentioned in the small print, the intention is still clear. The Telegraph's Science Editor Sarah Knapton was named in the HARTleaks as being a useful conduit for mainstreaming anti-vax messaging, a role she has continued for years now. Allison Pearson also of the Telegraph used the paper as vindication of her support for a campaign against child vaccination. She claimed there was no benefit of vaccination and pre-vaccine argued that parents should have covid parties to infect their children. Those who wanted children infected seem to only care about myocarditis when it comes to vaccination. The Daily Mail headline, and the first half of this article follows the narrative coming out of the Trump administration, quoting Vinay Prasad of the FDA. The second half of the article peppered with ads does cover the paper more accurately as the alternative viewpoint. In general when it comes to covid vaccines the Daily Mail is sitting on the fence balancing both views. This led to another article focused on the FDA choosing to add a black warning label to covid vaccines, which once again started with the views of Vinay Prasad under a supportive headline. The criticism of Prasad appears at the end of the article below severa",

At the time, the full dataset I use was unavailable due to the New Year's holiday, so I compiled a preliminary analysis based on data from selected states. Now that the complete dataset has been released, I wanted to send out an updated report with additional details. Note that this report covers data through the week ending December 27. Summary : Flu season is in full swing, with outpatient influenza-like illness (ILI) reaching highs not seen in more than two decades. Around 8.3% of visits to the doctor were for fever and cough or sore throat during the last week of the year. This season is driven by a new variant of influenza A, called H3N2 subclade K.

Along with many other people watching the data, I couldn't see where these warnings were coming from. Yes, flu season had started early but there was nothing to say - at that time - that it would be worse than previous years. I wrote about it in a December substack post and spoke about it on Sky News . I was worried that this was a bad use of data to scare the public - and striking doctors - into specific actions. A month later, and it's clear that this was not a worse flu year than previous years. Flu admissions peaked in mid December. While the most recent hopsital admission data (to 29 December) shows a small increase in hospitalisations 1 , we are nowhere near 2022 or 2024's peaks, or (so far) overall numbers, even if we get a double peak like we had in 2023/24. Meanwhile, RSV admissions steady but relatively high, and Covid admissions are low and steady. If the government and NHS messaging was about trying to change the public's behaviour (and behaviour might have changed), then I don't think the approach is justified. Getting the public to get to a behaviour through misleading presentation of data from the people and organisations who are meant to be trusted experts is counterproductive and wrong. It's also lazy when you should make the effort to improve the situation through well-established public health measures. This includes improving physical infrastructure such as better ventilation (particularly in health care, school and crowded indoor settings), improving provision (better resourced GPs and hospitals), and better public messaging (e.g. emphasising ventilation and mask wearing alongside hand washing and surface cleaning, or staying home when sick). If the government and NHS messaging was about pressuring the doctors to call off the strike, then I find that cynical and unet",

We could be on the verge of ending the longest government shutdown in U.S. history-though nothing is guaranteed. While Congress debates whether to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) coverage, Americans with all types of insurance are bracing for higher premiums, narrower networks, and more impossible choices. So, to me, the debate in Washington is far too small. The real story isn't just whether subsidies stay or go-it's how completely insane our health care system has become, and whether there will be a serious effort to address underlying costs in the system. I know juuussstttt enough to get in trouble, so I partnered with the incredible Hayden Rooke-Ley, who is a leading national policy expert in this area, to break down the five ways the entire system has gone off the rails. Let's dig in. 1. Costs vs. wages: A 20-year disconnect. Over the past two decades, the cost of employer-sponsored health insurance-how the vast majority of privately insured Americans obtain their health care-has skyrocketed. Premiums, deductibles, and out-of-pocket costs have all soared-far faster than wages. Figure made by Hayden from cobbling together a few sources, including Kaiser Family Foundation and CMS Health Expenditure Projections . This widening gap means workers earn less, even when their salaries rise on paper. Every dollar going to premiums is a dollar not going to rent, groceries, or childcare. And the human toll is clear. One in three Americans has medical debt, and more than half worry they'll fall into debt any time they use the health care system. That fear changes behavior: people delay appointments, skip medications, or avoid care altogether. Medical debt is now the most common form of debt in collections ahead of credit cards, utilities, or personal loans. Nearly 60% of those in medical debt have insurance. 2. We pay the most and get the least. The United States spends far more on health care than any other wealthy country yet achieves worse outcomes, l",

In addition, the cases reported in 2025 significantly exceed the average and maximum numbers of reported cases in the years 2018 to 2024. The most cases of hepatitis A in 2025 were reported by the capital city of Prague (1376 cases), the Central Bohemian Region (471 cases) and the Moravian-Silesian Region (261 cases) Of the total number of 3256 cases reported in 2025, 2514 people were hospitalized in the infectious disease ward (77.2%). Among those who died last year were thirty men and six women, aged 35 to 82. Most of them had chronic liver disease or engaged in risky behavior, such as drug use or alcohol addiction. \"The risk of severe disease and death increases with age and is higher in people with chronic liver disease or weakened immunity,\" the institute added. Until 1965, hepatitis epidemics in the former Czechoslovakia recurred every year. After that, the hygiene level gradually improved, especially in connection with the availability of safe drinking water and the expansion of the sewage system. The overall trend in the development of hepatitis A morbidity in the Czech Republic has been decreasing since the mid-1960s; The exception was a large-scale foodborne epidemic in 1979, when the number of reported cases exceeded 32,000. The last increased incidence of viral hepatitis A in the Czech Republic was recorded in the 1980s; the number of cases ranged from approximately 1,500 to 3,500 cases per year. In the 1990s, the number of reported cases continued to decrease; an average of 870 to 2,080 cases per year were reported. Thanks for reading Outbreak News Today!

The language of the current news cycle on weight loss drugs reeks of moral panic. The talk of a rebound in weight after coming off these drugs uses language like \"weight recidivism\" and \"addiction\". Fingers are being wagged. The drugs are only a \"quick fix\" they say, implying that patients who have bypassed the proper path of diet and exercise are cheats. Despite everything we have learned in recent years about obesity being a chronic condition, the language speaks of a threat to someone's values of effort and hard work. I can't understand why effort and willpower still occupy the moral high ground among scientists when we have had a close to 95% failure rate for this strategy. (Obesity, by the way, was defined as a chronic condition in 2013.) Obesity isn't a moral failure When effective weight&#8209;loss drugs arrived a few years ago, patients and doctors greeted them with joy and relief. At last there was an effective tool for obesity and related health problems. The main drawbacks were: excessive loss of muscle mass, the fact that treatment had to be ongoing, and potential side effects. Nonetheless, for many these drugs are revolutionary. There was substantial weight loss, and the rapid improvement of cardiometabolic risk factors such as blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol. Even early on, before we had a full picture of their benefits to heart health, and other conditions, we were told they were likely to be a more important drug class than statins. Today the headlines are pretty bleak. \" People who come off slimming jabs regain weight four times faster than dieters \"; People who stop taking weight-loss jabs regain weight in under two years ; Stopping obesity drugs means people regain weight and lose heart health benefits: Going off medication brings more changes more quickly than ending diet and behavior programs ; Weight-loss jab users &#8216;pile pounds on much faster when they stop '.

Weight loss, brain health, bone health, muscle health, longevity&#8230;protein can do it all. (But can it do my laundry? I digress). Is everything you put in your mouth filled with protein? WHY NOT? IT IS THE ONE DIETARY INGREDIENT TO RULE THEM ALL. The protein pressure is real, but how much protein do we need? This is a common question, and it's no wonder as in 2025 we approached protein monism, where protein is everything and everything is protein. (Monism is an idea or doctrine where there is only one thing or one kind of thing). Obviously, we need protein. Just like we need fats, carbohydrates, and vitamins, etc. But we also need to enjoy our meals and not feel like life is one big hunt for the next protein bolus that we can hopefully choke down. Let's start with what people really need, because 2025 was filled with some pretty serious protein myths, such as women in menopause need more protein per kg of body weight than anyone else or if you have 20 g or less of protein in a meal that it gets turned into sugar. It seemed like a lot of people were engaged in protein one-upmanship in the fight for attention on social media. The evidence-based recommendation for protein is 1.2-1.6 g/kg/day. This means that someone who weighs 80 kg needs 96-128 g per day. A competitive athlete may need a little more (maybe 1.6-1.8 g/kg/day). It's ideal to divide the protein into three meals, aiming for at least 20-30g per meal, but total protein matters more than timing throughout the day. (There are probably nuances in how protein should be divided up throughout the day for competitive athletes.) In North America, many people fall short on protein at breakfast, so finding ways to get a little extra protein here could help many people meet their protein goals. Elizabeth Ward and H",

The cases were reported from Anoka, Dakota and Hennepin counties. This follows a 2025 where 1,284 confirmed/probable pertussis cases reported in 2025 as of Dec. 31. Counties reporting the most cases include Hennepin (221), Ramsey (104) and Dakota (102). Seventy-eight percent of cases (999) were reported in children 17 years of age and younger. Preliminary number of pertussis outbreaks reported in 2025 as of Dec. 31, 2025: 128 Infants and persons who are pregnant are at higher risk of severe illness from pertussis. In 2025, there have been 78 cases in children under 1 year of age, with 39 occurring in infants under 6 months of age. 5 cases have occurred among those who are pregnant. Of all cases, 28 cases have been diagnosed with pneumonia, and 27 cases have been hospitalized due to pertussis this year. MDH reminds the public it is important to be up to date on vaccinations. While vaccine protection can wane over time, those vaccinated typically experience less severe illness. Pertussis, or whooping cough , is a disease that affects the lungs. Pertussis bacteria are spread from person to person through droplets produced during coughing or sneezing. A person with pertussis develops a severe cough that usually lasts four to six weeks or longer. Pertussis can be very serious, especially in infants. The first symptoms of pertussis are similar to a cold: sneezing, a runny nose, possibly a low-grade fever, and a cough. After one or two weeks, the cough becomes severe, such as: The cough occurs in sudden, uncontrollable bursts where one cough follows the next without a break for breath. A high-pitched whooping sound occurs when breathing in after a coughing episode. Whooping is less common in infants, adults, and people who have received pertussis vaccine. Vomiting during or after a coughing spell. The person's face or lips may look blu",

Welcome to the Ogre Nation anyway! &#128293;Burn Fascism To The Ground!&#128293; Prefer a one-time tip? We got you! Zohran Mamdani has been mayor of New York City for less than one week, and he's doing the one thing that the legacy press loathes above all else: He's improving life for the average American: NEW YORK (WABC) -- Governor Kathy Hochul and Mayor Zohran Mamdani made a historic announcement Thursday that puts New York one step closer to providing universal child care for all families. Hochul said the state will pick up the cost to launch a program called \"2 Care\" in the city starting in September. It follows the Trump administration saying it is freezing child care funding in the city and other blue states. The program will work with home-based providers and build on the existing 3-K program to provide child care for 2-year-olds. The program launches in \"high-needs\" neighborhoods this September, before expanding citywide, fully phased in by the 2029-30 school year. Kathy Hochul is not what one would call a bone-deep progressive. She is, however, not an imbecile. She knows her only path to reelection depends on riding Mamdani's coattails, and she's not going to fuck around and find out. This presents a problem for the legacy press, particularly the New York fucking Times. They are heavily invested in Mamdani's failure. They would much prefer to see the mayor at loggerheads with Albany and struggling to achieve a single piece of his \"radical\" agenda to make the city more affordable for non-millionaires. But Hochul is not interested in the feelings of the NYT editorial board. She's interested in getting votes, and that means giving Mamdani what he needs to get the job done. If she keeps that up, expect the Times to target her as well. My gues",

    "text": "The moral panic about GLP-1 rebound Scientists and journalists are piling on the misery about the weight regain after medication AI generated. The language of the current news cycle on weight loss drugs reeks of moral panic. The talk of a rebound in weight after coming off these drugs uses language like \"weight recidivism\" and \"addiction\". Fingers are being wagged. The drugs are only a \"quick fix\" they say, implying that patients who have bypassed the proper path of diet and exercise are cheats. Despite everything we have learned in recent years about obesity being a chronic condition, the language speaks of a threat to someone's values of effort and hard work. I can't understand why effort and willpower still occupy the moral high ground among scientists when we have had a close to 95% failure rate for this strategy. (Obesity, by the way, was defined as a chronic condition in 2013.) Obesity isn't a moral failure When effective weight&#8209;loss drugs arrived a few years ago, patients and doctors greeted them with joy and relief. At last there was an effective tool for obesity and related health problems. The main drawbacks were: excessive loss of muscle mass, the fact that treatment had to be ongoing, and potential side effects. Nonetheless, for many these drugs are revolutionary. There was substantial weight loss, and the rapid improvement of cardiometabolic risk factors such as blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol. Even early on, before we had a full picture of their benefits to heart health, and other conditions, we were told they were likely to be a more important drug class than statins. Today the headlines are pretty bleak. \" People who come off slimming jabs regain weight four times faster than dieters \"; People who stop taking weight-loss jabs regain weight in under two years ; Stopping obesity drugs means people regain weight and lose heart health benefits: Going off medication brings more changes more quickly than ending diet and behavior programs ; Weight-loss jab users &#8216;pile pounds on much faster when they stop '. The negative headlines, and scientific commentary, co",

    "text": "Blair bids to build own AI tools to rival Palantir TBI insiders warn of “'insane” plan to transform think tank into a tech company By Peter Geoghegan, May Bulman and Beatriz Ramalho da Silva When it comes to AI, Tony Blair is a true believer. He's said that the technology can transform society for the better, and herald a new industrial revolution that will make us all more productive, more secure and more equal. But the former British prime minister isn't just an AI evangelist advising governments on how they should use AI. He's now getting in on the tech bro act himself. We can today report that Blair's eponymous think tank has been spending heavily on developing its own AI tools that it hopes to sell to governments in what insiders describe as a bid to \"rival Palantir\". Democracy for Sale and Lighthouse Reports have spoken to dozens of current and former staff at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change over the past year as part of our investigations into the influence of Big Tech on government. Multiple sources confirmed that TBI has set up a new in-house \"AI Incubator\" in a bid to \"get on the AI bandwagon\", while cutting staff in other areas and posting financial losses. TBI was made aware of all points in this article prior to publication but declined to comment. Democracy for Sale is a reader-supported publication. If you aren't already, consider becoming a paid subscriber to support us. The AI Incubator, where top earners reportedly make up to &#163;370,000, is developing tools to help political leaders make decisions, with plans to sell them to governments clients, particularly authoritarian Gulf states, according to insiders. The move has caused internal concern, with some saying it is \"insane\" for a non-profit to try to compete with major tech companies. But \"Blair sees the Incubator as his legacy,\" one former employee said. Senior leadership at TBI are said to be hoping that the AI Incubator, which was launched last Spring, can transform the non-profit entity into a tech company. The Incubator is not expected to be offered as a competitor to OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude",
